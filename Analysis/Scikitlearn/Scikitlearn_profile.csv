sure. There is another check_array pr that might be conflicting
and that I think is very important
the dtype=object one

yeah maybe that was a bad idea. but it was already broken before
I know the bugs are unrelated, but I thought the fix might be. I was thinking about removing the implementation of partial fit, which would make it easier to fix both bugs, I think
args I meant fit_transform
err fit_predict?
"
54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b,89,2015-02-26 19:47:00,"fyi https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4285 should be good
I had some weird behavior with the interp1d but I need to do some NYU stuff before I can investigate further

"
54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b,115,2015-03-02 21:54:00,"possibly. I didn't have much time to look at them yet
this is not really a priority as I want to get stuff clean and fixed for the release first

54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b,118,2015-03-02 22:40:00,"haha I just saw it and thought you read my message ;)
anything I should look at now? btw, does beta mean uploading docs?
probably not I guess?

I'll have a look soon.
probably with ``estimator__``. But I'd rather go with a tree, which should work

"
54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b,243,2015-03-18 15:26:00,"there is also AgglomerativeClustering, which is much faster and easier to understand than AF
and provides a hierarchical clustering
well ok if your point is to understand how to implement AF on MR then go for that. I just don't see why you would want to do that, as AF is a crappy algorithm.
There are a also papers about implementing good clustering algorithms on MR
"

omerzimp there is none. Pyspark is the closest, I'd think. there are also python interfaces for h2o and graphlab/dato

"
54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b,322,2015-03-23 15:09:00,"Ok you are just building a regressor. By application I mean: does this ever work better than a random forest? Also, is that what people currently use in symbolic regression? And does that work better than greedy expansions of variables in a linear model?
@ogrisel would you still have them in the ``.utils`` module? I thought about introducing ``._utils`` and just moving (backward-compatible) all the non-public API there?
but maybe I should rather spend my time on reviewing the LDA and GP PRs  or finishing the MLP.
Btw, for the MLP, I'm not 100% certain on how to do nesterovs momentum. I find the paper was not very clearly written, but maybe I was just tired
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4436 just passed

@ogrisel do you think this is a good idea: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/4445 we could ask cangermueller to do it, he didn't have much opportunity to prove his coding skills yet, I think

maybe not
next we should push the 0.16.0 version, trigger the buildbot, and move the docs, right?
are you working on any of these?

"
54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b,613,2015-05-05 21:27:00,"makes sense, but we can also not wait for the fix in pandas.
@ogrisel so I think we should maybe just copy the DF in the ""rare"" situation that happens and throw a warning that people should use .values to avoid the copy?

so the plotting examples are ""not that critical"" for the release. Though it would be nice to fix them

"
54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b,1746,2015-11-21 01:14:00,"@AAnoosheh you can use SVM(probabilities=True) which will use Platt's method for calibration of the decision function. Or you can use CallibratedClassifierCV to use Isotonic REgression to calibrate an SVM
you can use Nystrom together with LogisticRegression
just set n_components in Nystroem to n_samples and it will give you exact kernel logistic regression
make_pipe(Nystroem(n_components=n_samples), LogisticRegression())
does kernel logistic regression
platt's method in libsvm does 5-fold cross-validation, so it is 5 times as expensive at one SVM.
I don't even know how one would implement KLR in any efficient way, as the dual is dense
I guess you could do SMO or a similar coordinate descent solver?
anyhow, I would expect SVM+Platt do be much faster than KLR, unless you set the parameters such that all samples are support vectors

yeah we're not gonna expand beyond the model that is there. we want to make the mlp as good as possible, so we will add dropout, and if there is a consensus for a better of-the-shelf optimizer than adam, I think we'll be happy to add that, too

you have some latent variables that correspond to your payloads, and when you sample, you have a chance to sample from a random poisson(?) or to exactly(?) pick out the payload

I need to scale the data to use keras (LSTM)
so I train on some set and the test on another
how should I scale the test set?
if this method doesn't guarantee it will be in the right range
hmm.. I don't actually know.. it's just that all the docs says you should scale everything to be in the range 0 to 1
ok thanks.. It occurred to me that you could just scale the test set independently too
which wouldn't be ""cheating"" but would give you the guarantee

e.g. if you wanted to predict whether an employee has access and you were given information about their salary, working hours, and favorite place to eat lunch on amazons campus. this is only 3 features, but its quite evident that where they eat lunch on amazons campus likely has no correlation / is not related to whether theyd have access.
actually thats not necessarily true, maybe there are more high scale places reserved for executives or something but do you see my point?
Yup.

While making `master` work with `master` is easy (just change the import path), the challenging part is to make work out-of-date version with a newer scikit-learn.

so I do not have enough data for cross-validation
"
55502d0c15522ed4b3e03330,3364,2017-06-07 19:23:00,"so in this case
the decision_function is `array([[-1.00000001,  0.        ,  0.3495638 ,  1.00000001,  1.        ,         0.5530018 ]])`
the evaluation for class 1 is 0
so close to 0 is better?
isnt that the distance to the hyperplane?
I dont get the same output as yours
no no
I copied your code
it returns an array of 6 elements

Can I ask here ?

I had another question. I had a offline conversation with another core developer of  scikit-learn
I want to use BallTree with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance and that core developer warned me against it and asked me to use Haversine instead.
Any reason why ?
PyProj provides great circle distances and I can define a custom metric. What is the objection in doing this ?
Not sure what pyproj is doing - https://jswhit.github.io/pyproj/pyproj.Geod-class.html#fwd
but the author told me it is the  most accurate
"
58d1e48dd73408ce4f52af1b,4168,2018-08-01 09:54:00,"yes you are right. I did ask  Jake
No I mean I do not understand how asking pyproj would help. The question is why I cannot use pyproj's great circle distance with scikit-learn

57007657187bb6f0eadd96e8,4372,2019-03-15 17:54:00,"thats just chaning how you look at it, not really changing the properties of it
just checking I understand your problem though. You are saying in your training set, you have min max output of  something like  .2 - .6 and so you are scaling that to 0-1.
It depends on the problem you are trying to solve. You'll have to decide if it is appropriate for your problem or not.
what min max scaling does in that case is stretch the predictions between .2 and .6 to a higher resolution, and then make evertying outside .2 or .6 equal to each other
if that makes sense to do will be application specific
