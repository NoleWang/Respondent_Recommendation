This is similar to Recurrent Network,   where input Xt=(x0,...,xi,.. yt-1, yt-2) depends on past output states Yt.  If we could put the exact output states Yt, it creates a bias in the training. So, wondering how we can put  recurrent states in Random Forest training.

As I undersatand it with most ML examples you have a number of test data in tables and each table row is a data point. When I want to predict something, I take data that has the data structure of one table row and see that I predict the wanted data based on the test data training. In my case I have the table + column metadata (column name, length, etc) plus the actual content of the table column. My first idea is now to create a new table with (table name, colunm name, length, ctable column content as a string ,lets say) and then copy the column content column by column into this structture. This would give me individual rows to analyse. It just feels a bit clonky as the meta data (table/comuln name, ..) would be naturally the same for a whole column and only the column content differs and so there is not much variation in this table.

Linear scaling mathematically should not have a direct impact for most models and methods. I think the linear scaling will just factor out of everything. Of course, it might help with numerical stability if the target has extreme values.  Basically, intuition is that for regression methods, min F(X) - y is same problem as min F(X) - \\alpha * y but with a modified X. For example, you could just scale the weights of the last layer to get the different Y.   With SGD or whatever method you are using to solve, you could of course get different results with scaled y.   This is not a proof of course ... just found this: https://roamanalytics.com/2016/11/17/translation-and-scaling-invariance-in-regression-models/#Scaling-does-not-affect-unregularized-regression  which is potentially a good illustration of the details.\n@nisnt2411 Hi, I dunno I jumped in recently without even asking anything :).

I created a custom scorer that takes in `y_true` and `y_pred` and returns the correlation (see below). However, I stuck a `print` statement in there to verify the shape of what's being passed to the scorer. I'm using `KFold` cross-validation with e.g. _k_ = 10, which for 200 samples will return splits with shapes `y_train` = 180 and `y_test` = 20. It seems that both arrays of shape 180 and 20 are being passed to the scorer for evaluation. As if the scorer is being run on both the test set (expected) and the train set (unexpected, for me).

And no, a struct member cannot be a memory view.  I tried to make my own class but then got yelled at because it's not of type `Splitter`, so that was a bust.   I augmented the `SplitRecord` with 2 cpp vectors, but that caused things to go wonky requiring cpp in files that I'm not willing to touch.   I ended up augmenting `SplitRecord` with 2 Cython vectors with hard-coded length, but then can't seem to initialize a memory-view into them inside of the `node_split`.  I'm pretty much stuck (in my current view of things), because I'm trying to do as little modification as possible, but it seems that in order to accomplish my task I'll have to re-write a big chunk of ensemble methods. I'd have to add an input argument to the `node_split` method? That doesn't sound like a good idea.  Any ideas?

Can anyone clarify to me how `OneVsRestClassifier` performs the classification to decide the output of each input? I am coding a RBF network for classification and the output layer is trained with `n_classes` linear regressors, then the final output is given by applying a softmax function.

By running a sort of window function over it. The index then is sample number, the first array is the input features, and the second array is the target.  If I input my data values as X into a pipeline, how to address the following: my custom transformer generates y from the input X, but the pipeline requires a y to begin with my custom transformer changes the length of X, which I think the pipeline also complains about.  Especially the latter is really important to me, as I want to be able to change the amount of features in X.

I have a question regarding one of the examples left in PR #21958. `/examples/linear_model/plot_sparse_logistic_regression_mnist.py`. I guess this one is left because is not as straightforward to accelerate. This example involves a logistic regression using the saga algorithm and l1 penalty. In my attempt to optimize it, I found out that most of the running time is spent fetching the data instead of running the regression itself. The most I could do was 5% faster, which translates to 2 seconds difference. Unfortunately, by reducing `train_samples` the running time is not meaningfully decreased.  Another option I considered was to run LogisticRegression with `tol=0.9` and `n_jobs=2`, and `max_iter=40`. Unfortunately, can't get more than 5%.  One of the tweaks I managed to do was in the plot itself, by running the reshape outside the plot and using a list comprehension itself. Overall it makes the plot faster.  Checking other PRs, it seems that the acceleration obtained in this example is quite low. I am not sure even if this is an example that can be further improved considering the most expensive operation here is `fetch_openml`. For the same reason, not sure submitting a PR with such a low improvement is even a good idea.  I appreciate your thoughts on it. Maybe I'm missing something relevant.

The overall idea is to train a 1D embedding using a pretrained GLM. For this, I take a pretrained Poisson Regressor model trained using scikit-learn(this is GIVEN and persay has been trained on 50 features), I want to add a new feature to it i.e a random variable X ~ N(0, 1) and retrain the model to get a 51 parameter model. Once this is done, I treat the input X as a parameter, freeze the model and get optimal value for X_i using gradient based approaches. Finally, upon having the optimal set of X_i, I want to retrain end to end using all 51 features. This is the gist of the algorithm that is designed.

So, i have to implement a classification task using scikit-multiflow for a big dataset (84 feature x 2,5 milion of exemples), processed like a stream. After many and many attempts my code finally run without warnings or errors but there is a problem: i am using the class Evaluate Prequential and its methods for the classification and, by setting adquate metrics to evaluate the goodness of this classification, i obtain very high values for each metric used. This is \"strange\" considering the dataset i am working on, reason why i want to generate the confusion matrix in order to understand on wich classes my classification algorithm works better and on wich classes it makes more misclassification. Generating confusion matrix is very easy using scikit-learn, but this method needs to have as input parameter true labels and predicted labels and here is the problem: i cannot isolate from Evaluate Prequential, in particular from the method \"evaluate\", predicted labels, consequently i have no way to generate the confusion matrix because i have not predicted labels to make a comparison with true labels.
