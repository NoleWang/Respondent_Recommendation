<s> <user> hi ! i have a quick question about the capabilities of <unka-> 's pipeline ( also asked in the other channel ): currently my data looks like the following 0 20 1 23 2 25 3 29 4 24 ... where the index is a step in time , and the value is the value associated with that <unka> . i am <unka> it into 0 [ 20 , 23 , 25 ] [ 29 , 24 ] 1 [ 29 , 24 , 24 ] [ 23 , 22 ] 2 [ 23 , 22 , 26 ] [ 23 , 25 ] ... by running a sort of window function over it . the index then is sample number , the first array is the input features , and the second array is the target . if i input my data values as x into a pipeline , how to address the following : my custom transformer generates y from the input x , but the pipeline requires a y to begin with my custom transformer changes the length of x , which i think the pipeline also complains about . especially the latter is really important to me , as i want to be able to change the amount of features in x . other options for example would be : 0 [ 20 , 23 ] [ 25 , 29 ] 1 [ 25 , 29 ] [ 24 , 29 ] ... or even 0 [ 20 , 23 , 25 , 29 ] [ 24 , 29 ] 1 [ 24 , 29 , 24 , 24 ] [ 23 , 22 ] etc . is there a standard solution for this , or should i write a wrapper for this ? thanks in advance ! </s>
<s> <user> our pipelines are unfortunately no meant to change the number of samples or the target . so i guess this kind of <unka> will have to happen outside of the pipeline <unka-> ... </s>
<s> <user> is there a specific reason why that is prevented from being changed ? </s>
<s> <user> if the goal of the pipeline is to do parameter tuning for size of the <unka-> of the feature extraction preprocessor in a <unka/> ( for instance ), then i think it 's better to switch to a parameter tuner with a more flexible less opinionated api such as URL/https:/ <unka./> for instance . </s>
<s> <user> thank you ! </s>
<s> <user> > is there a specific reason why that is prevented from being changed ? our transformers where never meant to change y . this is an early design decision that is really hard to change now ( without breaking users code ). and changing the number of samples without changing y is meaningless . </s>
<s> <user> that 's a shame , because i can imagine <unka> different sampling strategies generating additional samples with differing noise levels would be a very useful thing to put in a pipeline so it can be <unka> . </s>
<s> <user> i 'll have a look at <unka> , thanks for your answers ! </s>
<s> <user> but 's really trick to get right , especially with the metrics . for instance when dealing with <unka> <unka> problems , you want to <unka> at training time but not at test validation prediction score time . <unka> learn has a custom pipeline and a custom api for <unka> transformers with the <unka_> method : URL/https:/ <unka-./> however this is not what you want for your use case : you want to perform the same transformation both at fit and predict time . it 's hard to express all those use cases in a simple and intuitive unified api that would not led to users to shoot themselves in the foot . and there the backward compat constraints to take into account which makes it really hard to make our api evolve in that regard . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> would you mind reposting this question to github discussions : URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unka-/> i think this would make it more <unka> and <unka> for others that have related issues . </s>
<s> <user> very understandable ! i 'm just sad i could n't get an easy way out :p i 'll repost it there when i can , likely later today . </s>
