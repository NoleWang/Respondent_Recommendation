<s> <user> my guess is most of the time is spent on <unka_> or <unka_> in <unka> . if i were to investigate , i'd add a few logging info in those areas to see what 's happening , but probably most of them are in <unka> space . we do n't really have logging in those areas , if you want to figure it out , you should add it to your copy of <unka-> and see where the time is spent . </s>
