<s> <user> <unka@> without looking at your approach i know that cameras automatically adjust themselves to keep the brightness of an image in a " useful range " . i do n't think this is a good project for someone starting in machine learning . the only way i see this working is that the algorithm needs to understand about certain camera " artefacts " and then use these to interpret the brightness . i ca n't see this working short of a deep <unka> network . </s>
