<s> <user> <unk#a@> out of interest what does it look like in the pr , does it just add a " done " comment when you click on the " done " button ? not sure how useful this is to be honest . generally when you do something following a comment , it gets hidden into an " outdated diff " section anyway . </s>
<s> <user> for some reason it does n't work for me ;( it might be useful for those comments that are n't hidden after the change i think ... ;) apart from that you are right ... its not really that useful since the comment gets hidden anyways ... </s>
<s> <user> i'd love if someone did a firefox extension which shows " outdated diff " comments . i know there are some <unka> on the internet but it never worked for me somehow , i always end up having to copy and paste the code in the javascript console , not great . </s>
<s> <user> as as in does not hide them by default u mean huh ? </s>
<s> <user> see for example URL/https:/ <unka./> <unka-/> </s>
<s> <user> install [ <unka(-./:]> ) and add this script to it , ( you can enable or disable greasemonkey if you are n't using it for anything else ) to enable/disable expanding the diff comments ... <unk`> <unka=> <unka@> github expand outdated diff comments <unka@> <unk#a_> ADDRESS_@gmail.com <unka@> URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unka*-/> <unka@> 1 <unka@> none <unka/=> <unka"$'()-.> ) <unk`> </s>
<s> <user> one thing i wish the github pr page to show is a list of all the referred links and <unka> or issues in a neat side bar like stackoverflow has at the right , next to the question area ... i am planning to write a greasemonkey script for that ... i think it will be super useful to have all the links at the right instead of searching through the pr ... </s>
<s> <user> looks interesting , i 'll give it a shot , thanks ! </s>
