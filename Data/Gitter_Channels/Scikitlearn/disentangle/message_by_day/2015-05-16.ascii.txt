[16:45] <550f53e215522ed4b3dda5f6> Yes. I am currently reading the Murphy's paper 'Fitting a Conditional Gaussian Distribution'. That's the paper described three kinds of co-variance matrix in current  GMM implementation. But it seems a little harder to understand in terms of notations. @amueller 
[16:46] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> @amueller yeah ;) :P working on completing my exiting PRs :)
