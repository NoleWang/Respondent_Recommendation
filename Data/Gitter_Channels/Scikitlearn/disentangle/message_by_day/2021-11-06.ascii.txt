[02:26] <matrix-sumitdatascience:matrix.org> Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone could get older versions of scikit-learn that are below 1.0.0 installed in a Python 3.9 virtual environment. I think there is no wheel for scikit-learn 0.21.0 or 0.21.1 that works with Python 3.9, so it has to be built from source, which doesn't work very well on a lot of systems. I know installing with Anaconda works, but I was curious if there are some solutions to get it to work with Python 3.9's typical pip install command.
