[02:02] <5537027215522ed4b3df56ab> perhaps, it's an issue with sparse datasets. I wonder what the general solution to this kind of thing is.. adding noise?
[04:24] <5537027215522ed4b3df56ab> I was thinking of adding support for bayesian logistic regression since it's commonly used in the R world, but it  doesn't seem to scale to large number of features, because of MCMC + then we need pymc as a dependency.
