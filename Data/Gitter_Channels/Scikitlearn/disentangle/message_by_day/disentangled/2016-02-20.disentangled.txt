[15:52] <544906e2db8155e6700cdd16> @Fredilly Here's my two cents... I think that the difference that you saw in the results is related to the metric used by Kaggle to measure the performance: Area Under the (ROC) Curve. According to this issue (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1393) the auc score will give better scores if you feed it with probabilities instead of binary decisions.
