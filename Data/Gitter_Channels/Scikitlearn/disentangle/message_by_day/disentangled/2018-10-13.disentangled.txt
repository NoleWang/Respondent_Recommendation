You may find more information in the following places: - https://hmmlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ - https://machinelearningmastery.com/make-predictions-time-series-forecasting-python/ - https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/
[15:29] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> @talatccan that would be a start. But please note that issues such as preprocessing and scaling your inputs and/or outputs, and hyperparameters of your models, may substantially affect your results. You can refer to the resources posted above your message for more information.
