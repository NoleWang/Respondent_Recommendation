[08:35] <56f0af1085d51f252aba1606> Hi guys,  I meet a MemoryError problem when using minibatch k-means for clustering a data set with 1,700,000 rows and 5 cols. My desktop has 8G RAM and the scikit-learn version is 0.17.1. I searched google and found a same issue fixed by updating sklearn (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3048). Due to the algorithm of minibatch kmeans, I think 8G RAM should be enough. Anyone has ideas about this situation? Thanks!
