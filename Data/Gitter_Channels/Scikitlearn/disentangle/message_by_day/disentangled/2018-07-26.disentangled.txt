[13:36] <5a5a272ad73408ce4f880912> Hello! My name is Tushar.  I recently finished a course on machine learning and now I'm making some projects. One of them is object classification, I have googled all I could.  The problem is, I am confused on how to preprocess the images to work. I have worked on text. Now I am having troubles with images. All the things  I saw were using deep learning and tensorFlow. Articles with sklearn were using the dataset already provided in datasets. And that wasn't helping. If anyone can guide me, I'd appreciate it. Thanks
