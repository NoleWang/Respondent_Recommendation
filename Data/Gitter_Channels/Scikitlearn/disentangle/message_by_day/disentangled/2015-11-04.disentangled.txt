[18:50] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> thanks for having a look
[18:51] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> when I called "make dist" there were latex errors and the build didn't finish

[21:05] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> does anyone have matplotlib 1.5 to test the examples?
[21:06] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> I'm trying to pip install it in my conda env. I'm sure that's going to go great

[22:35] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> if anyone wants to help me find out why "clustering" isn't properly linked on the website, that would also be sweet ^^
