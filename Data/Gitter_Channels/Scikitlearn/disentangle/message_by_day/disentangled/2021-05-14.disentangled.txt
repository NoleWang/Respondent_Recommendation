[13:19] <matrix-rthy:matrix.org> Well you need to define what are your feature variables and the target variable. So for instance you could try to predict the position from all the other variables. Correlations would be taken into account depending on the model. So for instance if your model is linear the target would be a linear combination of the features. If you do have a known analytical relation between your variables it might be easier and more reliable to use scipy.optimize or scipy.odr to find the coefficients you would like to learn though.

[20:31] <609c828b6da03739847c7c73> Thanks for your answer, I forgot to mention that I fit my data with KDE and I sample new particles from this model. Is this model keeping the correlation between the different variables? Or it assumes the variables are independent from each other? Thanks again!
