[18:35] <584d9ad9d73408ce4f3c4b46>  am asked to only stimulate a smart device in c++ that could belong to the IOT. Although, I am not entirely sure what to choose. I have been given an example such as a weather device, also it is to produced data by 3 (simulated) sensors. For example the weather device, may register data from temperature, air pressure and wind speed sensors. Any ideas on a device i could choose?
