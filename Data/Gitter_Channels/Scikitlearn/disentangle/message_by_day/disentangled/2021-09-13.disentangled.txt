[10:30] <613f27626da0373984858a1f> I was kind of curious . Ive been dragging my feet using torch and I was wondering does this lib offer anything over torch ? Maybe this is better suited for the low level scientist trying to learn theory ? Or is it just an alternative ?
[10:31] <613f27626da0373984858a1f> Omg Im trapped

So one might be better suited than the other, depending on the theory that you're interested in.
