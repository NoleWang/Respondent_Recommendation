[19:40] <5446d339db8155e6700cd529> Hi, anyone with Cython knowledge who would have an idea what is going on in here: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/tree/_tree.pyx#L817  To me, it seems like a node is being subtracted by an array of nodes, which is given as a pointer index. Also, it looks like the index arithmetic is done on the smaller value, causing supposedly a negative index.
[19:40] <5446d339db8155e6700cd529> Is it just the index being subtracted here, or is there something else happening here?
