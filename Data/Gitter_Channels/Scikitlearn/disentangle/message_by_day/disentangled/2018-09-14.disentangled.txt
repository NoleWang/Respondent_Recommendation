[08:44] <5b9b749bd73408ce4fa82693> Hi. I'm a student and am new to sklearn. One of my peers told me that once I get a job, I can't and shouldn't use sklearn for professional projects. Is this true? Is not sklearn completely open source and free to use?
[08:46] <5b9b749bd73408ce4fa82693> which license does it come under?
