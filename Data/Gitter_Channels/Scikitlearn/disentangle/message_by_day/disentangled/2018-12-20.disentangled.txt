Was wondering if it's possible to create a model for one-class classification (ie. training on normal data, testing on normal and novel data), where there are more than 2 features for each example. All the code I've seen online seem to only consider 2 features

[10:13] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> Those are hand-made minimal examples mostly for presentation purposes. I've applied SVMs to 22k+ features and have gotten good results. I guess that answers the question :) You may find the "Learning with Kernels" book useful if you decide to get deeper into the topic.
