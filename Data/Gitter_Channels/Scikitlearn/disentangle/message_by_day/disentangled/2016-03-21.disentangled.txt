[19:45] <56c4f19ae610378809c1f8ae> Will do, thanks for the reminder!

[19:47] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> I'm not sure who else is interested. If there is any other interested person, please make sure you submit it within the next 3 days as you won't be able to do so after the deadline... (don't worry about it being perfect. **Just make sure that you clearly outline, at a high level what you wish to achieve within the timeslot**...)

[20:34] <55a36f535e0d51bd787b3400> Hi everyone, (I'm not sure this is the best place to ask; else let me know.).  I'm trying to cross-val a KMeans clustering and retrieve the most likely cluster:  ``` kmeans = list() for x in X:     dist = pairwise_distances(x)     kmeans.append(KMeans().fit_predict(dist)) ```  Although the clusters are very similar across iterations, the cluster labels are (obviously) random.  Do you know how I can aggregate these labels to find the most robust clusters across iterations: e.g.  `cluster_idx = scipy.stats.mode([sample for sample in kmeans])`
