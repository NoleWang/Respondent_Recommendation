[11:30] <56ed0b8885d51f252ab9a1b8> I have images with different objects in them such as trees, grass,river etc and want to classify which object is present in each image. Can anyone help me do the following a) load all the images one time from a folder b)Extract features b) Concatenate all features features into a matrix or a vector. This is my link to the working files https://github.com/Ben-Kobby/My-Project.git. Thank you.

[11:34] <56c625c3e610378809c22760> Hey everyone, just had a small doubt. I'm trying to implement a feature selection algorithm which uses a term-category matrix. I'm trying to implement it on the 20NG dataset. Currently I'm using `CountVectorizer` to produce the term-doc matrix (by  transposing the output of `fit_transform`). However I want to create a term-category matrix from this by mapping the count in these docs to another matrix with 20 columns. What would be the most efficient way to do this mapping? Thanks in advance!

You could start with some simple youtube videos/blog posts explaining the concept of CART and learn more as you go (atleast that is what I did)... Please feel free to ping myself or Jacob (here or in e-mail) if you need any help.
