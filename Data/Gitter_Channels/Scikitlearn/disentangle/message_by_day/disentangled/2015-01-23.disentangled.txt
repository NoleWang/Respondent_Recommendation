[16:49] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> @mac2bua, I just saw your message. It's probably better to ask specific question with running code snippets on toy example data on stackoverflow. You might be interested in having a look at sklearn_pandas for feature extraction from heterogeneously typed columns. FeaturesUnion might also be helpful.

[17:48] <544906e2db8155e6700cdd16> @ogrisel Thanks a lot for the advice! Fortunately I found this very useful blog: http://bit.ly/1mPEEhH and I decided to start using feature union and pipelines. The result was very good! :smile:  I know that you are a member of the core team of scikit learn so I'd like to thank you, sklearn is so awesome!.  Just one more question: Is there any easy way to get the name of the features?  So often I needed to print out the names in order to understand the relationship between them and the different classes. I wrote some code that gather the information of the different vocabularies in the case of the textual or categorical features and the name of the column in the case of the numerical ones.  Sorry for my bad english!
