[21:32] <5b11caa3d73408ce4f9b96b5> I am working with text data. I'm using TfIdf right off the shelf. I noticed that MaxAbsScaler gives a better performance than StandardScaler(with_mean = False). I found this link: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_all_scaling.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-preprocessing-plot-all-scaling-py. This prompted me to try out different scaling transformers. Is there anybody who has worked with text data before ? I wanted to know if "selecting scaler" is worth time spending on ?
[21:33] <5b11caa3d73408ce4f9b96b5> If it is, the link uses feature distributions, outliers to select a scaler ? Do the above concepts make sense in the space after TfIDF transforms the text data ?
