[15:11] <5573124c15522ed4b3e184c2> Hi, all. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask my question - but I'd like to use Naive Bayes, training by a list of sentences with their own labels (i.e. multiple different sentences per label). However, each sentence carries a certain importance weight that I'd like for them to play a role in while classifying - some sentences I want to have more of an impact than others. I was considering just resampling these sentences and creating duplicates or whatever depending on importance, but that seems horribly inefficient (especially because importance values/weights are essentially continuous)  Is there any way to weight certain samples to be more important?  ***TL;DR:** In other words, my training data is of the form ```[label, sentence, weight]```, where I might have multiple different weights and sentences for the same label, of course. I'm not actually sure what the best way might be to go about classifying this using scikit-learn. Any ideas?
