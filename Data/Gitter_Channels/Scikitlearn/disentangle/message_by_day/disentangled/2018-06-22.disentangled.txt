[13:20] <5b2cf725d73408ce4f9e4022> Can you please suggest that linear regression is good or I need to use a time series model. My dataset is

[13:34] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> Based on its description, the dataset you linked does not look like timeseries data: it's a table of feature data and one can probably make the i.i.d assumption. This is not a series of events with a timestamp for each with a progressing time dependency.  For supervised regression of the number of hours of absenteism, I would indeed try linear regress ion (+ some feature engineering) and compare with a more complex model such as RandomForestRegressor
