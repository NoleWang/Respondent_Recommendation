[22:42] <5aecc12bd73408ce4f982900> Hi, I have a question about what `GridSearchCV` (or, in my case, `RidgeCV`) passes to the scorer for evaluation. I created a custom scorer that takes in `y_true` and `y_pred` and returns the correlation (see below). However, I stuck a `print` statement in there to verify the shape of what's being passed to the scorer. I'm using `KFold` cross-validation with e.g. _k_ = 10, which for 200 samples will return splits with shapes `y_train` = 180 and `y_test` = 20. It seems that both arrays of shape 180 and 20 are being passed to the scorer for evaluation. As if the scorer is being run on both the test set (expected) and the train set (unexpected, for me). Is this actually what's going on? If so, is this the desired behavior? Maybe my implementation of the scorer is screwed up, but couldn't figure this out from the documentation. Thanks, and sorry for any confusion! ```python def correlation_metric(y_true, y_pred):         y_true_demean = y_true - np.mean(y_true, axis=0)     y_pred_demean = y_pred - np.mean(y_pred, axis=0)     numerator = np.sum(y_true_demean * y_pred_demean, axis=0)     denominator = np.sqrt(np.sum(y_true_demean ** 2, axis=0) *                           np.sum(y_pred_demean ** 2, axis=0))     print(f"True shape: {y_true.shape}; Predicted shape: {y_pred.shape} "           f"Correlation: {numerator/denominator}")     return numerator / denominator correlation_scorer = make_scorer(correlation_metric) ```
