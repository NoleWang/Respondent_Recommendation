[15:44] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> Thanks @rvraghav93. I'll try to review soon. I have a couple of hundred emails I need to read, and we want to release this week, though
[15:44] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> @ogrisel (or anyone else) do you remember the recent blog post that explained tree-based models as linear combinations ?
[23:07] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> I don't think that was it. there was a way to explain the prediction made for a single point as a simple function of the features somehow
