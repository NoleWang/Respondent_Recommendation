[06:26] <589b9e0fd73408ce4f490ba4> @whiletruelearn Yes, of course it's is possible to participate in the sprint remotely.  I guess list of participants on the wiki is mostly there for organization reasons (booking the room of the right size etc). If you want to participate just comment on gitter (here or on the dev channel) during the sprint and someone will help get you started.
[06:28] <589b9e0fd73408ce4f490ba4> @rbhambriiit Word of one character are ignored because typically they are stop words (i.e. have no predictive power). If you want to keep them you can change the regexp in the `token_pattern`.
[06:30] <589b9e0fd73408ce4f490ba4> @DrEhrfurchtgebietend Thanks for the heads up. Yes, it should be fixed by https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/12436 I think
