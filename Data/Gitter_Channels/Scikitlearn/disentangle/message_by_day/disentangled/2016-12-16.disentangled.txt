I'm doing some research on hyperparameter optimization and I felt very impressed by the technique shown in this tutorial by @ogrisel  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFkRt3BCctg Do you recommend any similar package or any library that implement that technique? I was playing with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV optimizers but those seem to be less interactive versions of the one in the tutorial (more "blackbox")
