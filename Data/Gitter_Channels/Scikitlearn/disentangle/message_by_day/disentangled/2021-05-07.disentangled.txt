[02:45] <6094a87f6da03739847c04de> Hi everyone, I'm a graduate student at Cornell and I had a paper (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3429445) published a while ago in correcting the bias of feature importance in tree-based methods. Impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for high cardinality features (many unique values), which is already noted in the docstring of feature_importances_ in RandomForest. I just opened a new pull request #20058 to implement a new feature importance measurement based on out-of-bag samples, which is guaranteed to remove this bias.  I think this feature is going to be useful for scikit-learn users. Any comments or suggestions will be helpful!
