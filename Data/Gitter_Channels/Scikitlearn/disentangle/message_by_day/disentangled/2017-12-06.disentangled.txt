[15:40] <564789be16b6c7089cbab8b7> Apologies for being slightly OT but...does anyone know what I am doing wrong with xgboost? It seems amazingly slow when you have a large number of classes.  https://bpaste.net/show/ef817a256658 shows the problem
[15:40] <564789be16b6c7089cbab8b7> thanks to the wonderful scikit-learn make_classification

[16:51] <5623dda816b6c7089cb76c0f> Hi all. First of all sorry this question since it is not a sci-kit learn related, but I thought someone can help me out. I have some pet projects that Id like to start, but I am having some troubles to start. Can anyone point me out? or bring some ideas? Both involve unsupervised learning.  1. Id like to classify students using some economic information such as income, number of family members, etc. The classification should the economic status, e.g. low resources, medium, rich. The problem is that I dont have any labeled data. Can I approach this problem in a unsupervised way? (I tried with k-means)  2. I want classify academic papers using a taxonomy. Many librarians tag their documents in a specific way. In most cases, this tagging is different for each library. Tagging documents with a specific taxonomy will help search engines to retrieve documents. However, I found a taxonomy called Unesco nomenclature, but I dont know a way to match a document with an element/elements of the taxonomy.
