[13:36] <5baf7d9ad73408ce4fa9c9b2> @toldjuuso from what I understand `self.nodes` is both the array of nodes *and* the address of the root node (In C and thus in Cython, an array is just a constant pointer on the first value of that array) so `node - self.nodes` will be positive and it correspond to the offset between the final node `node` and the root i.e. it corresponds to its index in the `self.nodes` array
