[11:24] <592e4901d73408ce4f638303> Hello Everyone, I have a very specific use case designed around scikit-learn and wanted to see if it was possible to code it up. The overall idea is to train a 1D embedding using a pretrained GLM. For this, I take a pretrained Poisson Regressor model trained using scikit-learn(this is GIVEN and persay has been trained on 50 features), I want to add a new feature to it i.e a random variable X ~ N(0, 1) and retrain the model to get a 51 parameter model. Once this is done, I treat the input X as a parameter, freeze the model and get optimal value for X_i using gradient based approaches. Finally, upon having the optimal set of X_i, I want to retrain end to end using all 51 features. This is the gist of the algorithm that is designed. Any leads towards APIs or whether this is achievable or not would be really helpful. Thanks!
