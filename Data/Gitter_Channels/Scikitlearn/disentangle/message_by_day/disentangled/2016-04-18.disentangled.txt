[21:01] <544906e2db8155e6700cdd16> hi everyone, I'd like to compare different scorers for univariate feature selection. Currently scikit-learn provides chi2 and f_classif but I'd like to use others like document frequency, infogain and bi-normal separation too (here is a comparative study http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/forman03a/forman03a.pdf).  I've already written a vectorized implementation of infogain but according to the chi2 documentation (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.chi2.html#sklearn.feature_selection.chi2) it seems that it should return the infogain scores along with an array containing the p_values of each feature. How should I calculate/interpret that p_values?
