[10:38] <5e7de2b6d73408ce4fde36e6> Hi! I promoted the scikit-learn office hours on PyLadies slack and WiMLDS slack because many people don't seem to be aware of them. I also did a tweet via PyLadies Berlin (https://twitter.com/PyLadiesBer/status/1519981569343164417). I think that the biweekly office hours is a great initiative that is especially helpful for folks belonging to groups which are underrepresented in tech and open source. I hope that the office hours and also spreading the word about them in these communities will help with contributor retention.
