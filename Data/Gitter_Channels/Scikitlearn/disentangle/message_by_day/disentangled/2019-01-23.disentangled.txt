[15:07] <564e507e16b6c7089cbb6551> Hi everyone, I'm currently doing a pixel-based supervised classification of an image with the SGDClassifier. I want to include the spatial context between pixels in the classification besides the pixel intensity. So, I just found out about `sklearn.feature_extraction.image.grid_to_graph()`, and was wondering if there was a way to include this information (or the graph adjacency matrix) in the classification?
