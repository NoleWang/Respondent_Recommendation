[05:33] <565b339a16b6c7089cbc9958> This is the output that I got on trying out what you told me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[05:35] <565b339a16b6c7089cbc9958> I've recently upgraded my scikit version and prior to which I had installed 0.16 version whose source code I have been referring to.
[05:35] <565b339a16b6c7089cbc9958> I'll check out once again.
[05:37] <565b339a16b6c7089cbc9958> I used pip install -U scikit-learn and it says the requirement is up to date.

[18:53] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> hi anyone up here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:01] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> Yes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:06] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/5947
[19:07] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> i would like to implement this  if it is not already implemented (I couldnt find this in scikit library )
[19:08] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> The closest was  spectral embedding
[19:08] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> I havent explained the idea of the algorithm in the issue  but i can do that
[19:09] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> and the applications of the same too , as in recent years its gainig some popularity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:18] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> How popular is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:21] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> Also what kind of problems does it solve? You may want to include the answer to the prev questions in your issue :)
[19:22] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> I haven't looked into it exactly... will do so and let you know my view :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:30] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> as already mentioned some very popular uses are web graph minning , page ranking algorithms
[19:31] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> let me include some application based papers in the area

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:33] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> I'll let you know my views after I look into it. You may have to wait for core devs to respond to you in that issue before you can proceed. You can also make a detailed email to our mailing list linking your issue to attract more comments.
[19:37] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> Could you also add these questions and answers to the issue? (So that this discussion could reach a larger audience)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:35] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> fot the other part of the questions :: it is used   in  a semi-supervised setup  and can be used at problems requiring local and global scales of information using some sort of  label transfer but not limited to this

[19:40] <55f2a92f0fc9f982beb05d85> Hey Scikiters,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:41] <55f2a92f0fc9f982beb05d85> I would like to know if someone has a parallel implementation of DBSCAN .. or Knows how to use it on top of Apache Spark .. Thanks in Advance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:45] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> I may be wrong but isn't our implementation parallel?
[19:48] <55f2a92f0fc9f982beb05d85> No, the base one in Scikit learn is serial one .. I am trying now to use pySpark to paralleize it, but its really difficult as I am not aware of scikit learn, and I dont have plenty of time :) .. would appreciate if someone can help
[19:49] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> Afaik parallelization in scikit-learn is mostly done using joblib... maybe you should take a look at that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:54] <55f2a92f0fc9f982beb05d85> Do u mean, i should try to edit the scikit implementation to utilize Joblib, or u already using Joblib ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19:59] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> i will do that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[20:02] <55f2a92f0fc9f982beb05d85> @halwai  .. if u mean DBSCAN, would u please let me know then ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[20:11] <541d52b1163965c9bc205cf3> @Elbehery   i am sorry  i was not reffering to DBSCAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[20:27] <55f2a92f0fc9f982beb05d85> no problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
