[09:32] <5938174cd73408ce4f656da8> Hi all, I have a program to run pipeline with featureunion infinitely by putting into fit_transform function and training data. So may I know how to know program running status? I am using anaconda Jupiter notebook to run that python script. Million thanks

[14:51] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> there is a pull request for verbosity in pipelines, but I don't think it's merged yet
