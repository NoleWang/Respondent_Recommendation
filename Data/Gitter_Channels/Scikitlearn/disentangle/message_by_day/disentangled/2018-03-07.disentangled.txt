[05:27] <5a895aedd73408ce4f8da2b8> Hello all! I just finished compiling a survey with more than 350 open source software project members which, together with some communication theory, we used to define a set of **best practices and guidelines for using Gitter** (in fact, it probably applies to *any chat-like platform*).  If anybody would be interest on it, or in applying them in this community, or your other projects, there is a [small survey](http://bit.ly/survey-and-guidelines) you can fill to get the guidelines. The survey takes something between just *10 seconds to a maximum of 2 minutes to fill* and it is intended to help us validate the guidelines in the future.  There is also a small [article](https://medium.com/@fabiomolinar/validating-chat-communication-tools-guidelines-and-best-practices-fb8852f319da) I wrote with a really short description about the study; in case you would be curious about it.  Of course, feel free to send the [survey link](http://bit.ly/survey-and-guidelines) to anyone you would like to share these guidelines with.
