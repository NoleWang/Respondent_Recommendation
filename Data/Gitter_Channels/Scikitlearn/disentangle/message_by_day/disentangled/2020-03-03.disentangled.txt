[11:05] <5d1b262ed73408ce4fc50b53> Can we use an unsupervised algorithm to perform sentiment analysis? If no , how to extract dataset on the customer support conversation transcripts ? as I dont' have any dataset I looking for unsupervised model Please let me know how to proceed ?

[12:55] <5dbd6437d73408ce4fcfbf0f> Hi @vishu_rj_twitter it depends from what you need...which kind of sentiment analysis would you like to perform? Through unsupervised models you could in theory clusterise the conversations, and for this I'd suggest to have a look to bag of words techniques, word2vec, doc2vec, etc.  But I think you need to classify the conversation following some criteria that exploits the sentiment, right? In this case I don't see any alternative to a supervised classification. And like any supervised problem, find a godd training dataset it's not trivial at all.  But anyway, I'd be open to any further suggestion that could come from this chat. Hope it helped anyway.

[13:02] <5d1b262ed73408ce4fc50b53> @gbroccolo  I am looking for happy / unhappy ( or positive /negative) criteria sentiments. I have searched for the  customer support conversation transcripts , but I did not got any datasets . I have searched in kaggle and google . let me know if any other repository for such datasets

[14:25] <5dbd6437d73408ce4fcfbf0f> @vishu_rj_twitter have a look on NLTK package: there should be some basic implementation based on word's semantics (i.e. it extracts single words and check the presence of generally negative terms like "isn't", "aren't", etc.).
[14:29] <5dbd6437d73408ce4fcfbf0f> but, again, it strongly depends from what you define "positive" or "negative" in your sentiment analysis. In most cases, you need supervised approaches, and generally you need your own labeled datasets. Machine learning stops to be nice at the moment you realise  you need to label your datasets by your own :)
