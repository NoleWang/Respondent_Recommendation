[10:18] <57a061aa40f3a6eec05d8d26> Hello, I tried to use PredefinedSplit as CV for GridSearchCV. I have two sets, first is for training and second is for validation. I made indices array so that for training set indices I put -1 and 0 for testing set. I get reasonable results to grid.cv_results_, but when I test it with the second (testing) set, I get .99 which is clearly not correct. Why is that?
