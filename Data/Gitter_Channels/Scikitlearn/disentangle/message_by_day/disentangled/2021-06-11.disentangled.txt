[07:27] <60c1c1146da03739847e93c1> Hi all! We're working on a generic implementation of a discrete time survival model for random forests. Similar to [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-020-00682-z) and [this](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-019-0863-0). Basically, the idea is to split on hazard curves which are a bit like the class probabilities of regular classification random forests but then stratified per duration since inception of an observation. We want to use scikit-learn for a base. Is anyone here familiar with the random forest code? Also tips for a good PR are very welcome.
