I want things to be explicit and not implicit like this spending hours searching to find what's going on?  Stratification will always be the best but this is not possible with regression. So we stated in the `cv` argument doc and the user guide as well:  > When the cv argument is an integer, cross_val_score uses the KFold or StratifiedKFold strategies by default, the latter being used if the estimator derives from ClassifierMixin.  One should improve the documentation to make it explicit for the default `None` and add `cross_validate` together with `cross_val_score`.
[08:49] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> > On an additional note I don't understand the phrase In all other cases, Fold is used., so in the case of my example instead of using StratifiedGroupKFold is cross_validate implicitly using just Fold?  Oh actually this is already documented properly. `Fold` is a typo, it should be replace with `KFold` and link to the cv splitter.
