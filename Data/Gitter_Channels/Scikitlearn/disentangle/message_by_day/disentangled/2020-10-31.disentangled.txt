[19:29] <569f975ce610378809bd48e8> I am trying to use sklearn.decomposition.FastICA on the  audio files from https://cnl.salk.edu/~tewon/Blind/blind_audio.html  by Te-Won Lee. These have  been referenced in Prof. Andrew Ng's old lectures  on Independent component analysis. The unmixing does not seem to work with FastICA. All the code examples that I could find mix simple waveforms like sine, sawtooth with a simple mixing matrix and try to recover it back.   Does any one  have any  insights on this  ?
