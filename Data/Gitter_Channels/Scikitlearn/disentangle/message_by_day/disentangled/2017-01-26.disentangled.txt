[10:04] <58033d49d73408ce4f2e92ba> Hi all ! I have some trouble with the MinMaxScaler, I m using it together with a keras model with input with 3 features and 1 output . my xdate is of shape (XX, 3) and output (XX,1) , I dont have any issue when calling scaler.fit_transform on both input and output training data
[10:05] <58033d49d73408ce4f2e92ba> but when I try to call inverse_transform on my predictions I get errors like this : ValueError: non-broadcastable output operand with shape (18,1) doesn't match the broadcast shape (18,3) or ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (18,) (3,) (18,) or ValueError: non-broadcastable output operand with shape (1,1) doesn't match the broadcast shape (1,3)  (I tried so many reshape but nothing works as excepted :( )
[10:10] <58033d49d73408ce4f2e92ba> Using a different scaler for input and output fixes the issue but is it the only solution?
