[16:35] <5afe987cd73408ce4f99ce3b> Hi everyone, I am a developer who's trying to test multiple models in different frameworks. I just want to know if this idea makes sense - I want to create a single sklearn pipeline script for testing various models (all mapped to the sklearn-keras interface or using skorch). But from what I understand is that models are not just plain classifiers or regressors. The models are a combination and sklearn pipeline doesn't apparently support it. Is my understanding correct? Is this a futile effort? Can someone please help me out with this issue. Thank you. If there's an alternative, please let me know. I'm talking about object detection models. I really like the pipeline method/interface and would like to extend my models to match the same .fit, .predict interface
