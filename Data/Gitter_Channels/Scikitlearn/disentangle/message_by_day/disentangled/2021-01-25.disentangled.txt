[11:54] <52f100f45e986b0712ef4def> Hi All. Had a question about a possible discrepancy between user guide and autogenerated docs for LASSO Linear model. Auto-gen docs (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) says that:  ``` (1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1 ```  Is minimised.  However, the user guide seems to to imply that it's `||Xw - y||` rather than `||y-Xw||` (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#lasso).  `y-Xw` makes more sense to me. Am I reading something incorrectly, or is the user guide wrong?

[12:57] <5b4c9e4bd73408ce4fa10b88> @JosephRedfern both are the same. ||-x|| = ||x||

[12:57] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> I think the common way would be `y - y_hat = y - Xw`
[12:57] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> but they lead to the same
[12:58] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> as @jeremiedbb just mentioned :)
