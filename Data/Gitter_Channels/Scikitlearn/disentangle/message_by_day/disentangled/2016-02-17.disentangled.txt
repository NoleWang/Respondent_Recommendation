[09:42] <564789be16b6c7089cbab8b7> @rvraghav93  actually it might be worth saying what I do in practice. I run dictvectorizer with categorical variables and then missing values just become another category. It would be great to compare to that approach as it works quite well, at least when I use a decision tree based classifier/regressor
[09:43] <564789be16b6c7089cbab8b7> maybe it wouldn't work so well with other classifiers but that would also be good to know
