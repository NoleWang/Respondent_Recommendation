[01:40] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> I have a question! Should the examples in the old classes (at `cross_validation.py` et al.) use imports from `model_selection` or should I leave it as such?
[03:03] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> Any reviews for #4826 would be awesome! It will help in moving those Warnings out of the model_selection pr :)
