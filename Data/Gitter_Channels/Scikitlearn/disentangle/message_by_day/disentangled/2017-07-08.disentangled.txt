[13:12] <5960d940d73408ce4f6c33f4> hi guys, i am new to gitter. Not sure if this is right way and channel to post the doubt. but if it is, here is my doubt: I have to create a model to assign sales representatives in like 105 territories across united states based on sales-and other business rules like geo location - in each territory. But i am having hard time finding a solution to limit the size of each cluster based on sales, vicinity and few other parameters. So my question is how do i stop the cluster from growing when it meets a certain defined criteria/conditions.
