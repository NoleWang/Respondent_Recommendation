[15:57] <matrix-benny:michael-enders.com> I have a general question: If for my dataset a kneighbor classifier works well (compared to e.g. SVC and Random Forest),  are there other classifiers that might also work equally well?

[17:04] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> @benny Stuff based on distances then
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[18:33] <matrix-benny:michael-enders.com> can you give some examples?

[23:20] <60223b726da0373984618209> Hi everyone, I am not certain if this is the right place to ask. I am a first-time contributor. I love the library and it has helped me immensely in my studies so far. I was hoping to work on this issue as my first issue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18338  As far as I can understand, this issue requires that the documentation be updated, does that indicate the docstring within the function definition only, or is that referring to another piece of documentation?  One of the commentators on the issue also mentions ensuring there are tests that break if this documentation doesn't exist, how do I go about doing that effectively?
