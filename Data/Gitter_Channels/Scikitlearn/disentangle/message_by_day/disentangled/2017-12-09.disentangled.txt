[22:36] <5a2c58c8d73408ce4f8294ba> I am new to open source development but have worked with python for many year. I have found an issue I would like to solve. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/10279 I have read a fair bit on how to submit pull requests but I hesitate to do so because of my inexperience. Is anybody interested in doing a review of my code before I submit so that I do not burden the community at large?

[22:49] <5a2c58c8d73408ce4f8294ba> OK thanks. I will do my best. I am trying to get up to speed on something small then I plan to tackle the more complex issue I discussed with you before https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9947
