[16:57] <5cb5d739d73408ce4fbdddff> Hi. I am trying to develop my own Estimator based on TransformerMixin and BaseEstimator. To make sure I am doing things right I have added a test to my project : ``` import MyEstimator from sklearn.utils.estimator_checks import check_estimator def test () :      me = MyEstimator(**params)     check_estimator(me) ``` If I run the test, I get the following error message :  ``` AssertionError: The error message should contain one of the following patterns:                0 feature\(s\) \(shape=\(\d*, 0\)\) while a minimum of \d* is required. ```  I don't understand how I am supposed to take care of that. I am even more surprise because my fit_transorm method uses self._validate_data at the beginning. I would expect that function to take care of case like these. Could someone help me with that issue ?
