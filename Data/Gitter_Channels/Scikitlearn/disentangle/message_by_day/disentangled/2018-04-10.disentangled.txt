[13:48] <5a4f6d1cd73408ce4f864c42> @jotes35 i think the issue isn't fixed.  the only feasible solution is retrain it over there in the new architecture, and yes it seems to be because of different architectures, not because it's windows and ubuntu, it happens even on ubuntu and another version of ubuntu
[13:49] <5a4f6d1cd73408ce4f864c42> have a look at this https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/7891

[17:37] <551c051b15522ed4b3de2fea> in general, what are good starting points for `min_samples_leaf` in random forest classifiers? I find that `0.005` gives me decent results but Im afraid Im overfitting.
