[02:03] <5962cf1ad73408ce4f6c5b9a> I'm trying to understand when `fit_params` would be used in `_fit()` in a `Pipeline`.  ```python def _fit(self, X, y=None, **fit_params):     ... ```  Are there any example Pipelines that make use of this functionality? Is the point of this to allow passing additional data to a `fit`? If the point is to pass parameters what is the use case over adding these parameters to the estimators init? It seems like passing parameters would kind of go against https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1975 no?
