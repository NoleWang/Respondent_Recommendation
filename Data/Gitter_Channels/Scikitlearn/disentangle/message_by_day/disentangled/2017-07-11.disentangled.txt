[13:29] <54e07d6515522ed4b3dc0858> If you truly want to dynamically "stop growing a cluster" based on custom criteria, I don't think any of the scikit-learn algorithms have an API for that. Moreover, it would only apply to algorithms that incrementally grow clusters, e.g. hierarchical clustering. If your dataset is not huge and you don't need to fit many different models, you could try implementing your own hierarchical clustering with simple python logic, and add your own constraints. It's a fairly straightforward algorithm.
