[22:05] <5d5565e0d73408ce4fc880d5> Hey guys, me again: Regarding me previous message :point_up: [October 4, 2019 5:28 PM](https://gitter.im/scikit-learn/scikit-learn?at=5d97b97b0e67130aae15b693) I've gone through some more attempts that don't quite work.    @NicolasHug The blog post helped a bit with my understanding of memory-views, however I still have a few questions:  Can a memory-view be initialized `with nogil`? And no, a struct member cannot be a memory view.  I tried to make my own class but then got yelled at because it's not of type `Splitter`, so that was a bust.   I augmented the `SplitRecord` with 2 cpp vectors, but that caused things to go wonky requiring cpp in files that I'm not willing to touch.   I ended up augmenting `SplitRecord` with 2 Cython vectors with hard-coded length, but then can't seem to initialize a memory-view into them inside of the `node_split`.  I'm pretty much stuck (in my current view of things), because I'm trying to do as little modification as possible, but it seems that in order to accomplish my task I'll have to re-write a big chunk of ensemble methods. I'd have to add an input argument to the `node_split` method? That doesn't sound like a good idea.  Any ideas?  Much appreciated.
