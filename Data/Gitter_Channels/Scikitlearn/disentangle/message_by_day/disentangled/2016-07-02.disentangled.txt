[12:24] <54317aec163965c9bc208ec9> @nspaeth without looking at your approach I know that cameras automatically adjust themselves to keep the brightness of an image in a "useful range". I don't think this is a good project for someone starting in machine learning. The only way I see this working is that the algorithm needs to understand about certain camera "artefacts" and then use these to interpret the brightness. I can't see this working short of a deep convolutional network.
