[17:56] <58412a9ed73408ce4f3a3004> Hi everyone! I have been looking in to multi-output regression the last few days. I know that the scikit-learn package offers a class called multioutput regressor. This class will give every algorithm multi-output support by fitting model for every variable. My questions : Does this package take the relationship between the input variables into account? Which algorithm would work better , a model with a multi-output regression or without (some models support it natively ?
