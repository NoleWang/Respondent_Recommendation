[08:34] <5b58594ed73408ce4fa23ee3> Hi all, what's the reason why one shouldn't set other attributes during construction in sklearn estimators apart from those in the `__init__` signature (see estimator check: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/95d4f0841d57e8b5f6b2a570312e9d832e69debc/sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py#L2390)? If I understand it correctly, `clone` calls the constructor and so all other attributes will also be re-set.

[08:37] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> `clone` doesn't call the constructor with the expected parameters. The parameters are set in `set_params`. That means if setting some other attributes depends on some given attribute to `__init__`, and that logic is not duplicated in `set_params`, the constructor would be in an invalid state. Putting those in `fit` makes them all consistent.
[08:38] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> But there are ways where you can handle it with setting other parameters in `__init__`, and the estimator not going into an invalid state, if you know what you're doing, then you can ignore that test.
