This is the last training process where most of the valid loss are about 0.1. However the score I get from the 'cross_val_score' is about 0.49. The score I use is the 'neg mse' which is the similar to the loss function of the network  'mse'. I want to know why it happens and how to fix it. Thanks a lot.
