<s> <user> hello everyone . i 'm really new to machine learning in general and i have been working with some <unka> <unka> . i need some help :). my question is how do i know if the <unka> i have is minimum enough for good <unka> . to what do i compare this <unka> to ? </s>
<s> <user> i was able to create a model by curve fitting a set of data that has 5 variables using <unka> . the problem is i am unable to <unka/> this model into an older version of python ( version 2.5.2 ). is there a way to dump the <unka/> into mathematical terms in relations to these 5 variables so that i can use this prediction on the older python ? thanks </s>
