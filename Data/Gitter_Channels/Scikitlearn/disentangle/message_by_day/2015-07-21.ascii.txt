[22:10] <5583486615522ed4b3e220e5> Hi, I'm fairly new to machine learning/deep learning, but I'm currently working on a project where I want to classify some biological images. I want to initially run an unsupervised clustering of similar images that don't have  labels. Later on I want to take a set of labeled images and run some type of deep learning algorithm to aid in classifying the images. What are some ways i can get started? Any help would be really appreciated, thank you!
