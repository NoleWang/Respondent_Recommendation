<s> <user> the overlap of the shaded curve <unka> around 150 an 175 training samples would bring doubt to me , if wether this presentation is useful to judge the parameters impact - but i am alien to machine learning ;- ) </s>
<s> <user> hy guys , i 'm trying to learn <unka> clustering , but can not get into final step before giving data into clustering algorithms , hope someone will be able to point me out direction of next step to get two <unka> array from <unka> so it can be used by algorithms like <unka> or may be <unka> or something else <unk`> import <unka> as pd df = <unka'(-./:_> ) # c1 .. c5 - <unka> , d1 .. <unk#a> - dates , b1 .. <unk#a> - binary , 100k rows df = <unk#a'(,.[> ], 1 ) # do not understand how to deal with this df = <unka(.> ) # looking around , all <unka> data has values , treating nan for all binaries as false # going to convert all binaries into 0 .. 1 ints for c in <unka.> : if <unka'(.> ): <unka[> ] = <unka'(.[]> ) # totally not sure should such things be done <unka'(:> , <unka(> )) # 100000 df = <unka(._> ) <unka'(:> , <unka(> )) # <unk#> # not sure is it good idea at all # but after that i have reduced number of columns from 33 to 12 from <unka._> import <unka> sel = <unk#a(.=> * ( 1 - .8 ))) <unka(.> ) labels = [ <unka.[> ] for x in <unka(.=_> )] <unka'(:> , <unka(.> )) # 33 df = <unka(._> ), <unka=> ) <unka'(:> , <unka(.> )) # 12 # not sure do i need something like <unka> or <unka> ? # every example of clustering algorithms like URL/https:/ URL/www.youtube.com/ <unka-/=?> expect 2 <unka> array - kind of stuck here <unka(.> ) <unk`> </s>
<s> <user> seems that have found one way : step 1 looking around on data <unk`> from <unka.> import <unka> <unka> = <unk#a(=_> ) <unka(.> ) <unk#a_> = <unka(.> ) <unk#a(.[_> ], <unk#a.[_> ], <unka'=> ) <unk`> step 2 clustering in my case i definitely see 4 clusters so using <unka> <unk`> from <unka.> import <unka> km = <unk#a(=_> ) <unka(.> ) <unka'[> ] = <unka(.> , <unka.=> ) # append cluster column to <unka> <unk`> step 3 get usefull data <unk`> desired = [ ] for col in <unka.> : if col ! = <unka'> : <unka> = [ ] # will contain top 1 value from each cluster for cluster in <unka(._> )): <unka'().=[]_{> : col , col : <unk#a').[]}> ]) if <unka(.> )) > 1 : <unka(.> ) # we are looking only for columns that are changing between clusters xx = [ ] for cluster in <unka(._> )): x = { <unka'> : cluster } for col in desired : <unk#a=> z = <unka'().=[]_{> : col , col : <unka'> }) <unka[> ] = <unk#a.[]> ] <unka(.> ) <unka(.> ) <unk`> not sure if this is a right way but got answer <unka> with 6 columns ( 5 <unka> and 1 binary ) describing <unk#a> from each cluster ( 4 rows ) hope that may be helpful </s>
