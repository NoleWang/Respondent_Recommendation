<s> <user> hello all ( i am new to <unka> ), i am currently working on adding an <unka> version of <unka> 's <unka-> ( similar to <unka> ) algorithm into my fork of <unka-> : in short , the algorithm takes linear combinations of features and projects them with weights randomly selected in { <unk#,-> } to form a new feature to split on . the number of features combined at each split is a random variable . the current <unka`> only holds one feature , i need something to store a vector of features and a vector to hold weights . 1 . i tried initializing an <unka.> and using <unka> , but ran into gil issues . 1 . i tried to make an <unka`> class , but that ca n't be passed as a pointer into functions because it is a python object . 1 . i tried to <unka> the <unka`> struct in [ <unk#a#(-./:]_> ) but that did n't seem to work because vectors would then be of fixed length . 1 . i tried to use something similar to the [ <unk#a#(-./:]_`> ) but fell into the same problem as it was a class and could n't be passed as a pointer into a function . i am looking into using <unka> , but am not sure if that will fix solve my problem . does anyone have suggestions on how to best implement this in a <unka> way ? i.e . storing a vector of things while avoiding the gil and not using python objects ? </s>
