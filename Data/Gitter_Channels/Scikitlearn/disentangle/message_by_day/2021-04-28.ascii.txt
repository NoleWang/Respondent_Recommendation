[10:54] <54a6f79fdb8155e6700e5114> I would like to ask how to join two pereprocessors I did saved in two separate files. I have one file with a model and another with prerpocessor (doing average and filling NaN boxes)  then another file with a model (same estimator) and forth file is preprocessor for second model? I would like to merge these four files into two (one joint model and one joint estimator).
[16:15] <matrix-urosn:matrix.org> I have transformer1.file, model1.file, transformer2.file and model2.file (same estimator in model1 and model2). I would like to have tranformer_composite.file and model_composite.file.
