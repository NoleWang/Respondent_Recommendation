<s> <user> i recently built a rudimentary <unka> that identifies the news topic of a given article . i <unka> lots of news articles - as training data - off a website , with their labels . in terms of <unka-> , i removed <unka> , <unka> , <unka> all words , then computed the <unka-> values of the remaining words . i represented each article as a doc of its 25 words with the highest <unka-> values . then i decided on adopting a <unka> approach to the problem : upon getting the input article and determining its most frequent words ( after the <unka-> ), i find the 5 articles that have most words in common with the input article - and then i perform a majority vote . if a majority of the 5 articles are tech , then the input article is tech . what are some ways i can improve upon this approach ? </s>
