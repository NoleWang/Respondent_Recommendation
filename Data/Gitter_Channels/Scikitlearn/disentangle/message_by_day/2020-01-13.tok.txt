<s> <user> hey , i opened the pr to add <unka> to the related projects page : URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> i 've put it under the category for <unka-`> as it seems better suited here . i 'm still developing the <unka> <unka/> libraries for tensorflow and <unka> as of right now , so those plugins could go into the <unka`> export for <unka`> category later on ( to allow saving reloading then continue training <unka_> whenever after ). </s>
<s> <user> i also corrected the thing about " the creator of <unka-> " in my article :) srry again for the mistake haha </s>
