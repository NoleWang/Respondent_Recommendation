<s> <user> hi all . first of all sorry this question since it is not a <unka-> learn related , but i thought someone can help me out . i have some pet projects that id like to start , but i am having some troubles to start . can anyone point me out ? or bring some ideas ? both involve <unka> learning . 1 . id like to classify students using some economic information such as income , number of family members , etc . the <unka> should the economic status , e.g . low resources , medium , rich . the problem is that i dont have any labeled data . can i approach this problem in a <unka> way ? ( i tried with <unka-> ) 2 . i want classify academic papers using a <unka> . many <unka> tag their documents in a specific way . in most cases , this tagging is different for each library . tagging documents with a specific <unka> will help search engines to retrieve documents . however , i found a <unka> called <unka> nomenclature , but i dont know a way to match a document with an <unka/> of the <unka> . </s>
