[16:11] <588b6fe9d73408ce4f467366> @amueller is there  a reason that the new gaussian process classifier doesn't provide an error estimate on the fitted probability, similar to the gaussian process regressor?  I believe this can be done, similar as to how one would use the covariance matrix/Fisher information of logistic regression model to confidence bounds upon the fitted probabilities?  Thx in advance.
