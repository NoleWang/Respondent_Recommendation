<s> <user> hi all . had a question about a possible discrepancy between user guide and autogenerated docs for <unka> linear model . <unka-> docs ( URL/https:/ <unka-./> <unka./_> ) says that : <unk`> ( 1 ( 2 * <unka_> )) * <unka|> - <unk#a^_|> + alpha * <unk#a_|> <unk`> is minimised . however , the user guide seems to to imply that it 's <unka`|> - <unka`|> rather than <unka-`|> ( URL/https:/ <unka-./> <unka#./_> ). <unka-`> makes more sense to me . am i reading something incorrectly , or is the user guide wrong ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> both are the same . <unka-|> = <unka|> </s>
<s> <user> i think the common way would be <unka`> - <unka_> = y - <unka`> </s>
<s> <user> but they lead to the same </s>
<s> <user> as <unka@> just mentioned :) </s>
<s> <user> oh boy , what a brain fart ! apologies , i should have thought before posting . </s>
