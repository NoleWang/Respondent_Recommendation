[19:51] <5e3f3d7cd73408ce4fd915a4> Are there any plans to allow estimators to customize their expected precision for your estimator checks? The checks are great, but I've found that estimators I have fail because of precision issues (like a single element of a 60 element array being off by 5e-8). It would be nice to be able to at least have some rough measure of precision as an estimator attribute that the tests could then use to adapt their behavior.
