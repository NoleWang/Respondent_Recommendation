[20:07] <54b4f2d1db8155e6700e99c0> Quick question, why does KMeans accept y in its fit() ?
[20:12] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> For API compatibility with other supervised learning algorithms... (and to safely pass y through kmeans in a pipeline)
[20:13] <54b4f2d1db8155e6700e99c0> Thanks a lot @rvraghav93 :)
