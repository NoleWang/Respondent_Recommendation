<s> <user> <unka@> i have implemented a <unka> version in order to gain some insight regarding your fix <unk##> <unka.> approach during split is to remove the feature we split on and each child node does n't contain that feature . but again we are going to have to look at say <unk#a-> features .how did you overcome that . your help can go a long way into helping me . also i can make the code available to you . its actually from a book . thanks . </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> the idea is to keep a list of splitter and when scanning a feature , each sample is distributed to the given splitter to evaluate if this is a best split . once the feature is scanned , all the potential splits have been evaluated with a single scan . </s>
<s> <user> thanks <unka@> . </s>
