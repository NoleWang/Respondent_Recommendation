[10:09] <549fecafdb8155e6700e3675> Has autoencoder not been implemented in scikit ?
[10:43] <553d32d715522ed4b3df8b92> I suppose #2099 is a WIP for sparse auto encoder.

[11:20] <56b0803ee610378809bf7535> Does anybody know the answer?
[11:24] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> @AlexanderModestov please do not paste large (unquoted) error messages in the conversation but instead use a link to some gist or pastebin. Furthermore this seems to be specific to spark and not related to scikit-learn (the `sklearn` package does not even occur in the traceback) so I don't think this is the right place to ask such a question. You might want to ask this question on stackoverflow with the spark tag.
[11:41] <56b0803ee610378809bf7535> @ogrisel I'm sorry. It's not about sklearn ...
[14:13] <564789be16b6c7089cbab8b7> @vene  Hi. Sorry I meant logistic regression
