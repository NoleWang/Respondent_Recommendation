<s> <user> hi everyone ! i have been looking in to <unka-> regression the last few days . i know that the <unka-> package offers a class called <unka> <unka> . this class will give every algorithm <unka-> support by fitting model for every variable . my questions : does this package take the relationship between the input variables into account ? which algorithm would work better , a model with a <unka-> regression or without ( some models support it natively ? </s>
