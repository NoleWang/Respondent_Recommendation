<s> <user> hi , all . sorry if this is the wrong place to ask my question - but i'd like to use naive <unka> , training by a list of sentences with their own labels ( i.e . multiple different sentences per label ). however , each sentence carries a certain importance weight that i'd like for them to play a role in while <unka> - some sentences i want to have more of an impact than others . i was considering just <unka> these sentences and creating duplicates or whatever depending on importance , but that seems horribly inefficient ( especially because importance <unka/> are essentially continuous ) is there any way to weight certain samples to be more important ? <unka*:;> in other words , my training data is of the form <unka[`> , sentence , <unka]`> , where i might have multiple different weights and sentences for the same label , of course . i 'm not actually sure what the best way might be to go about <unka> this using <unka-> . any ideas ? </s>
<s> <user> ca n't you specify the weight as a parameter at fit time ? </s>
<s> <user> see : URL/http:/ <unka-./> <unka#./_> </s>
<s> <user> not sure if that answered your question </s>
<s> <user> that should do the trick ! thanks </s>
