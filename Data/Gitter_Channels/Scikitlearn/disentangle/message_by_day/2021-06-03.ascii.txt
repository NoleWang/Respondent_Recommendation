[14:43] <55cbc84e0fc9f982bead32a4> Hi folks, I am a master's student in CS and I have a question for you.  I am working on a multi-class text classification problem, and I am using scikit-learn to implement my solution. I want to predict for a paragraph x if x belongs to one out of seven categories of information. I already implemented my solution using your library, but I am not confident if the steps I am following are correct or not, or if I am missing something. Could you please take a look at the image below and give your opinion? If this is not the right place for this kind of question, please let me know. Thank you in advance for your contribution!  ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/ZSr7jAT.png)
