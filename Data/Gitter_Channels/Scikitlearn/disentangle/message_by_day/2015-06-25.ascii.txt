[07:08] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> too bad.
[07:34] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> Maybe you could try to send an email to the original author of the paper / dataset to ask for explicit permission for inclusion of the data in the scikit-learn toolkit (mention explicitly that its license is the BSD license) if they have the copyright on this data? We will off-course credit their paper in the description of the dataset.
[07:47] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> @amueller @vene quickfix in #4893 by @jmschrei for the windows test failures that causes appveyor to be all red since recently: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sklearn-ci/scikit-learn
[07:54] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> BTW, good news: I was contacted by the appveyor maintainer and we were upgraded to a much faster infrastructure (still for free). The builds run in 3-5 mins instead of 15-20min. This means that we might be able to run appveyor on the pull requests as we do for travis. Right now we only run them post-merge to master as it would have been too slow to process the full PR queues on the slow infrastructure.
[14:35] <550f53e215522ed4b3dda5f6> OK. I will send the author an email, and cc to @ogrisel, @amueller. Who else should I cc to @ogrisel ?
[16:35] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> it would be great to put the mailing list in CC but it's not possible to reply if there are not subscribed. So just us is fine. In case of positive outcome we can forward there authorization to the mailing list for the record.
