<s> <user> hi all ! i have some trouble with the <unka> , i m using it together with a <unka> model with input with 3 features and 1 output . my <unka> is of shape ( xx , 3 ) and output ( <unk#a,> ) , i dont have any issue when calling <unka._> on both input and output training data </s>
<s> <user> but when i try to call <unka_> on my <unka> i get errors like this : <unka> : <unka-> output operand with shape ( <unk#,> ) does n't match the broadcast shape ( <unk#,> ) or <unka> : <unka> could not be broadcast together with shapes ( 18 ,) ( 3 ,) ( 18 ,) or <unka> : <unka-> output operand with shape ( 1,1 ) does n't match the broadcast shape ( 1,3 ) ( i tried so many <unka> but nothing works as <unka> :( ) </s>
<s> <user> using a different scaler for input and output fixes the issue but is it the only solution ? </s>
