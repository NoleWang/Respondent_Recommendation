<s> <user> a general suggestion ... i feel it would be more helpful to debug test results if we replaced <unka> for tests by comment ... output when a <unka> is present for a test <unk`> tests all <unka> which support <unka_> ... ok tests all <unka> which support <unka_> ... ok tests all <unka> which support <unka_> ... ok <unk`> output when no <unka> is present for a test <unk`> <unka'(._> , <unka<> <unka'._> > ) ... ok <unka'(._> , <unka<> <unka'._> > ) ... ok <unka'(._> , <unka<> <unka'._> > ) ... ok <unka'(._> , <unka<> <unka'._> > ) ... ok <unk`> </s>

<s> <user> :) oh we do need to install a package , i thought it was a build-in option </s>
<s> <user> yea it will go in <unka-./`> after <unka`> install <unka`> </s>
