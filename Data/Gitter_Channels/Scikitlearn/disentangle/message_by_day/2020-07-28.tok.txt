<s> <user> hello , i understand this is a long shot , but did n't know where else to ask . i am running <unka> learn in an online judge environment ( <unka> ). such environment disallows syscalls ( for security reasons ). the <unka> is installed in <unka> environment . if i use <unka(),.> ) everything works fine . however , if i use <unka'(),.=_> ), the judge stops the process as the <unka> was apperently trying to make some disallowed syscall . what is the low-level difference between <unka> and <unka> <unka> ? is there a workaround for this ? </s>
<s> <user> could th eproblem be that the <unka> version tries to spawn another processes even with <unk#a=_> ?? </s>
<s> <user> could someone help me understand how the regression tree works in <unka> , is it created in the cart , using the standard deviation to create the leaves ? i did not find any manual implementation of the cart for regression . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> it 's probably due to some multithreading , probably in <unka> , and i think nowadays you can control that through <unka`> . <unka@> or <unka@> know probably much better </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thats other ondrej <unk.:]> thank you , i already tried <unka'.[_> ] = '1' <unka'.[_> ] = '1' <unka'.[_> ] = '1' <unka'.[_> ] = '1' or <unka> these variables , but with no luck so far </s>
