[10:15] <5474d9eadb8155e6700d8178> Hey all! :) @ogrisel You might want to set up gitter to get live activity feeds on the right! Choose github and travis under integrations ( under settings )
[20:57] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> @ragv done! thanks for the tip
[22:33] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> It seems that I broke travis but I cannot reach the report page. Running the tests locally.
[22:50] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> Ok fixing the broken tests ATM
