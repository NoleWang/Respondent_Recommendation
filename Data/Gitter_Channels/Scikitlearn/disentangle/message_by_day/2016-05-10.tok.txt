<s> <user> hello all , every time i get the error : " <unk#a.:_> while sending or receiving . traceback ( most recent call last ): file " DIR/data/ <unka/> <unk#a./> DIR/python/ DIR/lib/ <unk#a-./> <unk#a/> <unka./_> " , line <unk#> , in <unka_> raise <unk#a"(> from java side is empty " ) <unk#a> : answer from java side is empty <unk#a.:_> error occurred while trying to connect to the java server traceback ( most recent call last ): file " DIR/data/ <unka/> <unk#a./> DIR/python/ DIR/lib/ <unk#a-./> <unk#a/> <unka./_> " , line 690 , in start <unka(.> , <unka.> )) file " DIR/usr/ DIR/local/ <unka/> DIR/lib/ DIR/python2.7/ <unka./> " , line 228 , in meth return <unka()*,._> ) error : [ errno 111 ] connection refused <unk#a.:_> error occurred while trying to connect to the java server traceback ( most recent call last ): file " DIR/data/ <unka/> <unk#a./> DIR/python/ DIR/lib/ <unk#a-./> <unk#a/> <unka./_> " , line 690 , in start <unka(.> , <unka.> )) file " DIR/usr/ DIR/local/ <unka/> DIR/lib/ DIR/python2.7/ <unka./> " , line 228 , in meth return <unka()*,._> ) error : [ errno 111 ] connection refused " . my <unka-> : " <unka.> <unka.> <unka.> <unk#a> <unka.> <unk#a> <unka#.> <unka-./=> <unka.> <unka-:> <unka-:> <unka-:> <unk#a#:=> <unka.> <unk#a> <unka.> DIR/data/ <unka-/> " the amount of data is about 5gb . </s>
<s> <user> does anybody know the answer ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> please do not paste large ( <unka> ) error messages in the conversation but instead use a link to some gist or pastebin . furthermore this seems to be specific to spark and not related to <unka-> ( the <unka`> package does not even occur in the traceback ) so i do n't think this is the right place to ask such a question . you might want to ask this question on stackoverflow with the spark tag . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> i 'm sorry . it 's not about <unka> ... </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> hi . sorry i meant <unka> regression </s>
