[06:41] <5d677234d73408ce4fc98654> hello everyone. I'm really new to Machine learning in general and i have been working with some sklearn Regressors. I need some help :). My question is how do i know if the RMSE i have is minimum enough for good predictions. To what do i compare this RMSE to?
[17:27] <5d68027ed73408ce4fc99289> I was able to create a model by curve fitting a set of data that has 5 variables using GaussianProcessRegressor.    The problem is I am unable to export/load this model into an older version of python (version 2.5.2).  Is there a way to dump the equation/formula into mathematical terms in relations to these 5 variables so that I can use this prediction on the older python?  Thanks
