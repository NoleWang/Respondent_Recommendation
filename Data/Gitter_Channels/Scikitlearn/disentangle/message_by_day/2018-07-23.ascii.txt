[22:19] <5a2c58c8d73408ce4f8294ba> Hey guys, are there any prebuild Docker images to work with sagemaker for sklearn? They support Apache MXNet or TensorFlow directly but not sklearn. https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/scikit_bring_your_own/scikit_bring_your_own.ipynb
[22:25] <5a2c58c8d73408ce4f8294ba> This is an option if not https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker
