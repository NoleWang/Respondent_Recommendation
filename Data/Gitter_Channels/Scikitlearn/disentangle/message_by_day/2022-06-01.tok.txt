<s> <user> hey folks , i have maybe a silly question . but is there any fundamental difference between <unka._`> and doing it manually ? for instance , take a look at the example below , i ca n't figure out why the roc scores in red are different while the <unka> scores in green are the same ? i expect that the roc scores should match , unless i 'm doing sth stupid and have n't noticed yet ? </s>

<s> <user> i seems that <unka_`> uses silently a different splitting mechanism depending on label <unka`> . for <unka/> inputs , if the <unka> is a <unka> and y is either binary or <unka> , <unka> is used . in all other cases , fold is used . if that 's true then this is an undesired behaviour for me as a user . i want things to be explicit and not implicit like this spending hours searching to find what 's going on ? on an additional note i do n't understand the phrase <unka`> all other cases , fold is <unka.`> , so in the case of my example instead of using <unka`> is <unka_`> implicitly using just <unka`> ? </s>
