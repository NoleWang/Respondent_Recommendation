<s> <user> <unk#a@> thanks . i opened an issue . it would be very interesting to know what exactly <unka-> is missing from that list and if the things that are missing are worthwhile . </s>
<s> <user> guys what about adding an interface to <unka> and other transformers that can take a matrix and only operate on certain columns ? e.g . if <unka_> < 5 per column or whatever .... </s>
<s> <user> i 'm not sure how to use this encoder directly on a matrix mixed of continuous variables and <unka> variables . </s>
<s> <user> some others must have <unka> this ? </s>
<s> <user> also , is <unka._> a solution here ? i do n't see though how it would work with train + test together .... </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> i do n't think we have a workaround for this atm ;( we are working on making the pipeline objects more flexible ... </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> how are you solving that situation then ? i understand if there is no solution , but there must be some way to " work around " it , no ? just a list of transformers for each variable or something ? </s>
