<s> <user> <unka@> you should actually check out that pr i just linked ! it should be easy to make an <unka> in <unka> that supports <unka_> and then wrap it to be <unka-> compatible </s>
<s> <user> hi , i 've recently cloned the <unka-> repository . but i 'm having difficulty debugging the code in my pycharm editor . i keep running into the infamous relative import error . can someone pass me a reference that guides me on how to do it ? also , please take a look at my debug configurations and let me know if something 's wrong : working directory : <unka-:\> ( i already marked <unka> as the source root ) python interpreter is the virtual environment i created for this . running " pip show <unka-> " in this env correctly shows <unka'> : <unk#a'.> . script path : <unka-.:\_> i even tried using module instead of script for debugging : " <unka._> " . this just throws another runtime warning and fails . pycharm is using " pydev debugger ( build <unk#.> )". am i wrong to try and debug this file ? how can i debug the module as a whole ? some stack overflow discussions answer this but i could n't figure it out for <unka> . any help here would be greatly appreciated . thanks in advance ! </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thank you , i will take a look . in fact , i need not only <unka> to support <unka> but also support different base <unka> in one <unka> .. not quite sure if it 's possible </s>
