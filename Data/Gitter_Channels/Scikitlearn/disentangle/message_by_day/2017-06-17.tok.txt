<s> <user> hi all , has anyone in <unka-> tried to import some of the <unka> model methods used by <unka> or <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> hi all , so we have 25 images of dimension <unk#a> . we have labels assigned to each image as <unk#/> . there are 14 1s and 11 0s . what we need to do is we need to find pixels that <unka> 1 from 0 . also along with these <unka> pixels we also need to allot ranking to them based on their frequency in images with label 1 . any thoughts on how to do it ? </s>
