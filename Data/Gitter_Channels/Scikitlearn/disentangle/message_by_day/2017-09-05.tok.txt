<s> <user> i am confused by <unka-> 's support for <unka> <unka> . can you just use them like <unk#a> numpy arrays in <unka> learn and if so , is there still any need for <unka-> ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> you can use <unka> <unka> with numeric values as input to most <unka-> <unka> and model selection tools ( e.g . <unka_> and parameter search tools ). <unka-> can still be useful to do <unka-> feature <unka> although this also should be improved by default in future <unka-> versions . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thanks ! i ca n't tell by looking at the docs which parts of <unka> will work with <unka> and which wo n't . for example URL/http:/ <unka-./> <unka./> </s>
<s> <user> should i just assume all <unka> and regression functions will work ? </s>
<s> <user> yes , whenever there is <unka-`> as the type for x in fit and predict , numerical <unka> should work . </s>
<s> <user> thanks so much </s>
<s> <user> is there any way to get feature importance ( for a random forest <unka> ) based on <unka> ( area under the curve )? </s>
<s> <user> why is <unka> important ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> what do you mean by that ? you could do sequential feature selection for any arbitrary metric , but that requires fitting multiple models </s>
<s> <user> <unka-@> it 's the only sensible way i know to measure a <unka> where the number of items in each class is very different </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> i would like to know how much each feature contributes to the <unka> . does that make sense ? </s>
<s> <user> it would also be great if <unka> had <unka-> <unka> but that pr seems to have stalled a while ago </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> feel free to pick it up ;) </s>
<s> <user> it makes sense if you can define it ? ;) </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> i wish i had the skills ! </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> what do you mean by " it makes sense if you can define it " ? </s>
<s> <user> if you mean the <unka-> <unka> , is n't there a more or less standard definition by hand and till ? </s>
<s> <user> there are two standard definitions </s>
<s> <user> i 'm not sure what 's currently to do </s>
<s> <user> ah ok . looks like it just stalled on that observation URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a#-/> </s>
<s> <user> what does it mean for a feature to contribute to the <unka> ? how much will <unka> change if you leave it out ? that is just one step of sequential forward selection </s>
<s> <user> yes i think that makes sense . you just want to avoid rebuilding the model n times when you have n features </s>
<s> <user> i often have 10,000 features </s>
<s> <user> is there a more efficient way of doing this ? </s>
