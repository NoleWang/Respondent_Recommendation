<s> <user> <unka@> it seems that you're doing it right ... maybe double check that 1 . you're actually changing the sources , i.e . not anything in the <unka_> folder , 2 . the doc that you're changing is about a public <unka/> ( private tools are n't rendered in the doc anyway ) and 3 . that you're looking at the generated html in <unka/_`> </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> re 1 . you ca n't use ( let alone allocate ) numpy arrays when the gil is released because these are python objects . is there a way for you to allocate the arrays somewhere where the gil is held , and use memory views when the gil is released ? memory views are safe to use without the gil re 2 . is it still considered a python object if you use a <unka`> class and all the attributes are <unka`> as well ? re 3 . what vectors ? ca n't you use a view as a field of the struct ? </s>
<s> <user> also <unka@> i happen to have been writing about <unka> over the weekend ... maybe that could help URL/http:/ <unka-./> <unka/_> </s>
