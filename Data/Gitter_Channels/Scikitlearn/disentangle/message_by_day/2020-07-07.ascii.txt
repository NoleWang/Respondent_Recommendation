[13:33] <5baf7d9ad73408ce4fa9c9b2> Could be wrong but my impression is that we mostly use the word dummy to denote "something designed to resemble and serve as a substitute for the real or usual thing; a counterfeit or sham" (taken from google definition). That might not be true in the case of DummyClassifier/Regressor, where the name might come from the fact that these estimators are over simplistic. Though the previous definition could also hold for them. IDK. Changing their names will force lots of users to change their code though,  so it's not just going to be an internal change.  As a side note we also have a bunch of "sanity checks", deemed non-inclusive by twitter, and I'll admit I'm quite puzzled by this one
