<s> <user> hi , i have a question about what <unka`> ( or , in my case , <unka`> ) passes to the <unka> for evaluation . i created a custom <unka> that takes in <unka_`> and <unka_`> and returns the correlation ( see below ). however , i stuck a <unka`> statement in there to verify the shape of what 's being passed to the <unka> . i 'm using <unka`> <unka-> with e.g . <unka_> = 10 , which for 200 samples will return splits with shapes <unka_`> = 180 and <unka_`> = 20 . it seems that both arrays of shape 180 and 20 are being passed to the <unka> for evaluation . as if the <unka> is being run on both the test set ( expected ) and the train set ( unexpected , for me ). is this actually what 's going on ? if so , is this the desired behavior ? maybe my implementation of the <unka> is screwed up , but could n't figure this out from the documentation . thanks , and sorry for any confusion ! <unka`> def <unka(_> , <unka_> ): <unka_> = <unka_> - <unka(._> , <unk#a=> ) <unka_> = <unka_> - <unka(._> , <unk#a=> ) <unka> = <unka(._> * <unka_> , <unk#a=> ) denominator = <unka(._> ** 2 , <unk#a=> ) * <unka(._> ** 2 , <unk#a=> )) <unka"(> shape : { <unka._> }; predicted shape : { <unka._> } " <unka"> : { <unka/> <unk")}> return <unka> denominator <unka_> = <unka(_> ) <unk`> </s>
