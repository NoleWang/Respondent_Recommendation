<s> <user> hello , <unka> devs and contributors . i have a question regarding one of the examples left in pr <unk##> . <unka./_`> . i guess this one is left because is not as straightforward to accelerate . this example involves a <unka> regression using the saga algorithm and l1 penalty . in my attempt to optimize it , i found out that most of the running time is spent fetching the data instead of running the regression itself . the most i could do was 5% faster , which translates to 2 seconds difference . unfortunately , by reducing <unka_`> the running time is not <unka> decreased . another option i considered was to run <unka> with <unk#a.=`> and <unk#a=_`> , and <unk#a=_`> . unfortunately , ca n't get more than 5% . one of the tweaks i managed to do was in the plot itself , by running the <unka> outside the plot and using a list comprehension itself . overall it makes the plot faster . checking other <unka> , it seems that the acceleration obtained in this example is quite low . i am not sure even if this is an example that can be further improved considering the most expensive operation here is <unka_`> . for the same reason , not sure submitting a pr with such a low improvement is even a good idea . i appreciate your thoughts on it . maybe i 'm missing something relevant . thanks ! </s>
