<s> <user> <unka@> thanks a lot !! in my pr <unk##> the tests in the new module <unka_`> are not being run in <unka> ... any help would be really awesome !! :) i could use virtual box ... but earlier i had little success doing so :( </s>

<s> <user> you 'll squash all these commits soon ? </s>
<s> <user> you can replicate that by simply creating a foo folder and a tests directory with a simple failing test :) </s>
