<s> <user> this is the output that i got on trying out what you told me ! </s>
<s> <user> i 've recently upgraded my <unka> version and prior to which i had installed 0.16 version whose source code i have been referring to . </s>

<s> <user> hi anyone up here </s>
<s> <user> yes ? </s>
<s> <user> URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> i would like to implement this if it is not already implemented ( i couldnt find this in <unka> library ) </s>
<s> <user> the closest was <unka> embedding </s>
<s> <user> i havent explained the idea of the algorithm in the issue but i can do that </s>
<s> <user> and the applications of the same too , as in recent years its <unka> some popularity </s>
<s> <user> how popular is it ? </s>
<s> <user> also what kind of problems does it solve ? you may want to include the answer to the prev questions in your issue :) </s>
<s> <user> i have n't looked into it exactly ... will do so and let you know my view :) </s>
<s> <user> as already mentioned some very popular uses are web graph <unka> , page ranking algorithms </s>

<s> <user> hey <unka> , </s>
<s> <user> i would like to know if someone has a parallel implementation of <unka> .. or knows how to use it on top of apache spark .. thanks in advance </s>
<s> <user> i may be wrong but is n't our implementation parallel ? </s>
<s> <user> no , the base one in <unka> learn is serial one .. i am trying now to use <unka> to <unka> it , but its really difficult as i am not aware of <unka> learn , and i dont have plenty of time :) .. would appreciate if someone can help </s>
<s> <user> afaik <unka> in <unka-> is mostly done using <unka> ... maybe you should take a look at that ? </s>
<s> <user> do u mean , i should try to edit the <unka> implementation to utilize <unka> , or u already using <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> i will do that </s>
