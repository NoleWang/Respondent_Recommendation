[17:07] <5a32fea2d73408ce4f836261> Hi team, I am new to Cpython but really wants to play with the internals of sklearn. I want to test out some of the cdef classes in the pyx file but looks like the methods are inaccessible within Python. Any thought?   For example:  ```python from sklearn.tree import _utils ph = _utils.PriorityHeap(100) dir(ph) ```   And I cannot find call methods like pop, push.  Usually how does the workflow look like if I want to play with the internals of sklearn within Jupyter notebook.
