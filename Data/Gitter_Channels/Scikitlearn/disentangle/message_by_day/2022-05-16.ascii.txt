[18:31] <62828ace6da0373984968dd7> Hi everyone, i'm new in this community and i want to apologize in advance for any errors i might make in asking the following question. So, i have to implement a classification task using scikit-multiflow for a big dataset (84 feature x 2,5 milion of exemples), processed like a stream. After many and many attempts my code finally run without warnings or errors but there is a problem: i am using the class Evaluate Prequential and its methods for the classification and, by setting adquate metrics to evaluate the goodness of this classification, i obtain very high values for each metric used. This is "strange" considering the dataset i am working on, reason why i want to generate the confusion matrix in order to understand on wich classes my classification algorithm works better and on wich classes it makes more misclassification. Generating confusion matrix is very easy using scikit-learn, but this method needs to have as input parameter true labels and predicted labels and here is the problem: i cannot isolate from Evaluate Prequential, in particular from the method "evaluate", predicted labels, consequently i have no way to generate the confusion matrix because i have not predicted labels to make a comparison with true labels. For sure there is trick to get around this problem but all of my attempts since two days failed and i have no more ideas on how i could do it. Please, do you have an idea on how to solve this problem? Thank you a lot.
