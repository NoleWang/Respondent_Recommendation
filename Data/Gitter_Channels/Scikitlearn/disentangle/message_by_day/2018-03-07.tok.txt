<s> <user> hello all ! i just finished compiling a survey with more than 350 open source software project members which , together with some communication theory , we used to define a set of <unka*> practices and guidelines for using <unka*> ( in fact , it probably applies to *any <unka-> <unka*> ). if anybody would be interest on it , or in applying them in this community , or your other projects , there is a [ small <unka(-./:]> ) you can fill to get the guidelines . the survey takes something between just <unk#*> seconds to a maximum of 2 minutes to <unka*> and it is intended to help us validate the guidelines in the future . there is also a small <unka(./:[]_> <unk#a)-/@_> i wrote with a really short description about the study ; in case you would be curious about it . of course , feel free to send the [ survey <unka(-./:]> ) to anyone you would like to share these guidelines with . </s>
