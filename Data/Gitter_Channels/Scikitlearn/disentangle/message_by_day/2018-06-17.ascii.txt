We are planning on doing a small documentation sprint on a few open source libraries. The main organiser is planning to address some issues and structural changes in the pandas documentation and I wanted to help a separate group work on a different library. I thought that maybe https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/10453 would be a good issue to work on with a small group of people for about 2-3 hours since it overlaps nicely with the other group. Is that something that would be helpful and is there someone working on it already (did not see anyone on github picking it up so far)?
[11:50] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> I don't see anyone working on the issue for the moment and it seems a good opportunity.
[11:50] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> It would be beneficial for the project since we start to have some feature (e.g. ColumnTransformer) which can benefit from the pandas.
[11:58] <5824aa0dd73408ce4f3501a2> ok great, I see where we can get to on Thursday
