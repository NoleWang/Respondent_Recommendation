<s> <user> hi,all i am using <unka> <unk#.> i generated a training model using random forest and saved the model . these were done on ubuntu <unk#.> x86_64 . i copied the model to a windows 10 64 bit machine and wanted to reuse the saved model . but unfortunately i get the following traceback ( most recent call last ): file " <unka.:\> " , line 19 , in <unka(.=> ) file " <unk#a-.:\_> " , line <unk#> , in load <unka> = <unka(_> , filename , <unka_> ) file " <unk#a-.:\_> " , line 508 , in <unka_> <unka> = <unka(.> ) file " <unk#a.:\> " , line 864 , in load <unka> file " <unk#a.:\> " , line <unk#> , in <unka_> value = <unka(*> ) file " <unka.\_> " , line <unk#> , in <unka._> <unka> : buffer <unka> mismatch , expected <unka'_> but got <unka'> <unka'> what could be happening ? is it because of a switch from ubuntu to windows ? however i am able to reuse the model in my ubuntu . </s>
