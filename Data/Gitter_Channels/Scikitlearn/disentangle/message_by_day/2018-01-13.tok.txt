<s> <user> supposed to by who ? </s>
<s> <user> i 'm currently getting some errors in my <unka-> branch ( made some changes ). running tests via <unka> , produces some output on terminal , but since numpy arrays contains large number of elements , they are printed with a threshold . <unk`> $ <unka> <unka./_> <unk=> test session starts <unk=> <unk#a./:_> : in <unka_> <unka_> , <unka_> ) <unk#a./:> : in wrapper return <unka(*> , <unka*> ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ metric = <unka.<> object at <unk#a> > <unka_> = <unk#a([> , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , ... 0 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 2 , 2 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 0 ]) <unka_> = <unk#a([> , 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 0 , 2 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 , 2 , ... 0 , 0 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 2 ]) <unka_> = <unk#a([> , 0 , 0 ], [ 0 , 1 , 0 ], [ 1 , 0 , 0 ], [ 0 , 1 , 0 ], ... 0 , 0 ], [ 0 , 1 , 0 ], [ 0 , 1 , 0 ], [ 0 , 0 , 1 ], [ 1 , 0 , 0 <unk)]> <unk`> now the problem is how can i print the complete array 's ( i.e with <unka.=`> ). i tried to put <unka().=_`> in concerned test file as well as in <unka./> but with no success . do i need some <unka> option ? </s>
<s> <user> see here <unka_`> is printed with some threshold size . </s>
<s> <user> well , one thing i can do is , use the <unka`> statement and then use <unka`> with <unka-`> - <unka`> option . but i do n't think this is a good solution . </s>
<s> <user> hi </s>
<s> <user> <unk##> ready to <unka> , needs review . </s>
<s> <user> is <unka-> going to take part in gsoc 2018 ? if yes , i saw a couple of projects in gsoc 2017 wiki . since , there were no <unka> last year , is that project list still valid or are you guys going to come up with some other projects ? i would be willing to explore <unka/> projects . </s>
