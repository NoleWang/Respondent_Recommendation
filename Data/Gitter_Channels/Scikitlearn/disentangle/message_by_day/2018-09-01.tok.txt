<s> <user> i tagged my pull request with wip . however , right now , id like if someone would have a look over it . im not sure if my approach is the desired one . i could do some stuff on documentation of course , but it might be that my approach is declined entirely . so should i change the name of the request ? for completeness : this is the pull request ( URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> ). of course i know that time is precious for all of us . </s>
