<s> <user> thank you . maybe best model <unka> be a good addition ? </s>
<s> <user> i 'm not sure what you mean by best model . there 's no notion of best model , only one model is built . if you mean " model with the lowest training loss " that 's basically the model at the last iteration , under the assumption that the training loss is always supposed to decrease ( unless your learning rate becomes too high ). if you mean " model with the lowest training loss that does n't make the validation loss go up " , that 's what early stopping is supposed to give you ( and it 's preferable to the former ) </s>
