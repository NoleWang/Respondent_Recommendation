<s> <user> hi , i 'm trying to use pipeline for combining feature extraction and clustering . i see that there are ways in <unka> for <unka> a single column into one or more columns . what i would like to do is specify a new feature as a function of a number of features , inside a pipeline . i looked at <unka> , <unka> , and pipeline , but neither of these enable what i am looking for . do i have to create these new <unka*> before i put them in the pipeline ? or am i missing something int he documentation ? </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@_> maybe the <unka> is what you're looking for ? </s>
