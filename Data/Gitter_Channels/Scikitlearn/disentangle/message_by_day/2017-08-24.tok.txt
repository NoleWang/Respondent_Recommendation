<s> <user> anyone have experience <unka> multiple time series with similar inputs and outputs ? my problem is as follows : i have a bunch of products , and a bunch of locations at which the products are sold . each of these locations has a sales history , so essentially i have a time series for each product at each location . my goal is to forecast future sales of each product at each location . i have tried approaching this problem as a <unka-> <unka> problem however i ca n't wrap my head around how to build a generalized single model from multiple time series . would love to chat with someone if they 've had experience with this before . thanks ! </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> you should probably consider it as a time series data for each location . that way you will be only considering sales as a function of time and thus make your initial model simple . </s>
<s> <user> once you are able to make <unka> on that model and are able to understand it probably you can scale this model to encompass addtional dimensions like <unka> . point is to take only one location at a time . that should help you </s>
<s> <user> <unka-@> thanks for the feedback , yes that was my general approach before having a model for each location but unfortunately then i 'm reducing the amount of data significantly , from > <unk#,> data points in all for all locations , versus having sometimes <unk#<> for newer locations , i was wondering if there was somehow a way to <unka> the problem so as to only have one model which <unka> to all locations . </s>
<s> <user> this one seems a close match . not sure if this will help though . also not in python URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> cool , i 'll have a look at it </s>
<s> <user> thanks ! </s>
