[22:18] <5e860fd3d73408ce4fdefde9> @JohnPaulMSU15_twitter There are 2 interesting things I found after a bit of research . There is a parameter you can set for your SVM called `verbose` .  As such you can write: ``` cf = svc.SVM(verbose=2) cf.fit(X,Y) ``` Now , according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22443041/predicting-how-long-an-scikit-learn-classification-will-take-to-run) stackoverflow answer, setting this parameter will only output the number of iterations required for optimization as they finish, so they may only give you a hint.  The second and more interesting thing I found is this library : [scitime](https://github.com/scitime/scitime)  It does exactly what you need, trying to provide an estimate for your system. More info at the docs they provide :)
