<s> <user> i know this is going to sound like i am complaining , but i am not . in 2015 i suggested adding <unka> <unka/> to our metrics . URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> . it is now april 2019 and the pr is still in the works URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> it feels like someone could have coded up the <unka> score in a day and written tests in a week . is this sort of 4 year period normal or something worth exploring ? </s>
<s> <user> in fact it was implemented in 2017 i see in the issue as a jupyter notebook </s>
