[00:12] <59605bcbd73408ce4f6c2b60> Hey, I opened the PR to add Neuraxle to the Related Projects page:  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16100  I've put it under the category for `Auto-ML` as it seems better suited here. I'm still developing the serialization plugin/extra libraries for TensorFlow and PyTorch as of right now, so those plugins could go into the `Model export for production` category later on (to allow saving / reloading / then continue training / partial_fit whenever after). 
[00:18] <59605bcbd73408ce4f6c2b60> I also corrected the thing about "the creator of scikit-learn" in my article :) srry again for the mistake haha
