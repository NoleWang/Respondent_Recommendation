[20:27] <59d4936ed73408ce4f7883b1> @Rebaiahmed Sentiment analysis is iffy at best. Twitter is particularly bad. Training data is typically nice and clean, but Twitter users are are an insanely sarcastic bunch which makes this so unreliable. Plus it's pretty worthless. The move to 280 characters might improve this in the future but we'll need to get new training data.  What could be interesting is to do questionaries, and demographics and other data, then build a model that predicts opinions and responses based on that data. You could through in sentiment analysis here for longer paragraph answers if it really interests you.
