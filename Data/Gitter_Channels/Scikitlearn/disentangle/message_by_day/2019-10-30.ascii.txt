[15:10] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> a first good issue?
[15:11] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> a find it a bit harsh :)
[15:14] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> lol, I'm just a messenger, Joel tagged it as such :D
[15:14] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> Basically, I was starting to solve the issue yesterday
[15:16] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> While making `master` work with `master` is easy (just change the import path), the challenging part is to make work out-of-date version with a newer scikit-learn.
[15:16] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> In the latest case, we need to make some `try except ImportError` as you suggested I think
[15:18] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> Yep. If you're already at it, please leave a comment so that others don't start working on it ;)
[15:19] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> Yep I just cross-reference my PR
