[18:47] <558c0fd615522ed4b3e2b943> I should not call them chunks. They're folds. Two folds :) 
[19:03] <5b58594ed73408ce4fa23ee3> Yes, I understand that, but why can it not give me a single train and a single test set (`n_splits=1`) as `split_train_test` does? Because it's then not really folds anymore? 
[19:14] <558c0fd615522ed4b3e2b943> I guess `n_splits` is a bit of a misnomer. `n_folds` would've been clearer maybe.
