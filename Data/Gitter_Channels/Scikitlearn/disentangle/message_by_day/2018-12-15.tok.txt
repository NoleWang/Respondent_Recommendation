<s> <user> on <unka-> , when i look at our jobs , it says " projects currently running on <unka> 1.0 are no longer supported . please migrate to <unka> 2.0 ." up there , and the migrate thingy is a hyperlink . we already use <unka-> 2 in our pipeline scripts , but it'd be nice if we upgraded there as well i suppose . </s>
<s> <user> just posted in <unka/> but someone suggested i ask here too : does anyone where the <unka> folks hang out ? i am trying some custom store backend stuff with <unka> <unka> and want to see if anyone else is messing around in this space . feels like am between <unka> , <unka> and <unka> communities and want to make sure i 'm not missing something someone else is already doing . </s>
<s> <user> <unka-@_> <unka> folks are here ;) i think it 's primarily <unka@> and <unka@> ? </s>
<s> <user> pretty sure they have n't thought about <unka> though </s>
<s> <user> ( but <unka@> is probably the best person to know these three communities ) </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> <unka@> <unka@> basically just wondering if there is some hidden <unka> of custom store backend hackers out there , there are some interesting use cases with using something like <unka> ( decentralized ) as a <unka_> for sharing the cache globally but it means swapping out all the <unka> for something safer . i am just playing around but i would suprised if someone had n't gone down this route before . </s>
