<s> <user> hi everyone . i was wondering if anyone could get older versions of <unka-> that are below 1.0.0 installed in a python 3.9 virtual environment . i think there is no wheel for <unka-> <unk#.> or <unk#.> that works with python 3.9 , so it has to be built from source , which does n't work very well on a lot of systems . i know installing with anaconda works , but i was curious if there are some solutions to get it to work with python 3.9 's typical pip install command . </s>
