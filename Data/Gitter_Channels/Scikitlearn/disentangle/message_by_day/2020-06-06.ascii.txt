[10:14] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> I think the "go wanted" tag was removed from the issue cause we already have at least a half solution to the issue. Not sure if we want to work on it during the sprint @Mariam-ke 
[10:16] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> *"help wanted"
[10:17] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> Is it on the issue list for the sprint @Mariam-ke ?
[20:52] <5a9c7b4dd73408ce4f8fd92e> I have a small concern.  I am wondering if matplotlib should also be installed in setup.py along with NumPy and scipy. Is there is a reason it is not?
[21:33] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> @Sahanave there is no reason to. It's a soft dependency and many people run scikit-learn in a server setup where there's not even a screen attached
