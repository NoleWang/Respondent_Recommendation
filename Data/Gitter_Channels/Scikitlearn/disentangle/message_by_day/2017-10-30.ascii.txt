[16:39] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> I am doing this ``` In [1]: from sklearn.datasets import fetch_olivetti_faces In [2]: import pandas as pd In [3]: ol_faces = fetch_olivetti_faces() In [4]: ol_faces_df = pd.DataFrame(ol_faces.data) In [5]: pd.tools.plotting.scatter_matrix(ol_faces_df, c=ol_faces.target, figsize=(8, 8)) ``` But this programs tends to keep increasing memory usage, is something wrong that I am doing? I am not trying to do anything in particular on my own. I was just trying to 'replicate' (on self exercise type question) for what Alexandre Gram tried to do in SciPy 2017 tutorial.
[16:44] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> I am doing this on pandas version 0.19. I think we have `pd.plotting.scatter_matrix` in versions higher than 0.19 (i.e. development version I guess)
