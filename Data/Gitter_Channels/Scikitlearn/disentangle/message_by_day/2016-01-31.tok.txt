<s> <user> hi , lately i 've been trying to think for a solution to project structure and organization , i 've asked at [ <unk#a(-./:]> ) and [ <unk#a(./:]_> ), since i 'm using <unka> and creating new interfaces to the classes , i think this chat would be better . so ... how do you guys organize the entire project folder ? also , do you use pipelines , if so , <unka> do you place all the different transformer ? </s>
