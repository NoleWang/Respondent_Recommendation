<s> <user> <unka@> please do not spam this channel with repeated questions . the way you pose your image <unka> problem is very non standard . what does ranking pixels mean ? why do you want to do that in the first place ? is this a natural image <unka> problem ? in that case you will need much more than 25 labeled images to do anything useful as i already told you earlier . if those are not natural images then you should probably give more details on the nature of the images . which objects are in the images ? what are the two labels 0 and 1 ( what do they mean )? have the images been recorded with a traditional camera with three color channels or is it a very specific recording device ? </s>
