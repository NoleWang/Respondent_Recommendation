<s> <user> > not to my knowledge . what approaches were you considering and why do you think it might be beneficial ? there are cases where we seem to be allocating very similar sized blocks for arrays repeatedly ( e.g . enforcing fortran order on inputs , applying <unka> repeatedly on similar sized arrays ). the time for the allocations here is larger than i would <unka> expect , which makes me think that whatever default memory allocation scheme is running into issues . am debating the value of allocating a larger array that includes n such blocks and distributes sliced chunks of it for these allocation operations . this may be too naive , but this is my first thought . <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> does anyone get what i 'm doing wrong with <unka> ? </s>
