[09:54] <5b58594ed73408ce4fa23ee3> Thanks for the quick reply, yes, so, as long as there is no logic or interaction of attributes in `__init__`, I can initialise other attributes in `__init__`. We are developing a toolbox that extends sklearn to time series and currently have an `is_fitted` attribute in our base estimator which is initialised to `False`, any reason why this may be a bad idea? 
[10:04] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> That's just a bad idea cause we have a `check_is_fitted` utility function which should be used ;)
[11:10] <5b58594ed73408ce4fa23ee3> I know, I find having an `is_fitted` state cleaner than following the trailing-underscore convention :)  thanks for the help
