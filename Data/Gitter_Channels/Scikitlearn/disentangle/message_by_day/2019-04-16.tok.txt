<s> <user> i should not call them chunks . they're <unka> . two <unka> :) </s>
<s> <user> yes , i understand that , but why can it not give me a single train and a single test set ( <unk#a=_`> ) as <unka_`> does ? because it 's then not really <unka> anymore ? </s>
<s> <user> i guess <unka_`> is a bit of a misnomer . <unka_`> would 've been clearer maybe . </s>
