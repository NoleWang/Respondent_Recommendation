<s> <user> hi . i am trying to develop my own <unka> based on <unka> and <unka> . to make sure i am doing things right i have added a test to my project : <unk`> import <unka> from <unka._> import <unka_> def test ( ) : me = <unka(*> ) <unka(_> ) <unk`> if i run the test , i get the following error message : <unk`> <unka> : the error message should contain one of the following patterns : 0 <unka(\> ) <unka(*=\> , <unk#)\> ) while a minimum of <unka*\> is required . <unk`> i do n't understand how i am supposed to take care of that . i am even more surprise because my <unka_> method uses <unka._> at the beginning . i would expect that function to take care of case like these . could someone help me with that issue ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> : could you please open a github issue with full traceback and tag me ADDRESS_( <unka)@_> in ? </s>
