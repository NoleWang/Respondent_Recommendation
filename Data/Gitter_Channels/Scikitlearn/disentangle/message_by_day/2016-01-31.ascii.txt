[11:26] <5624bbb016b6c7089cb77b2a> Hi, lately I've been trying to think for a solution to project structure and organization, I've asked at [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35067412/python-machine-learning-data-science-project-structure) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/43ima5/project_template_for_data_scienceanalysis/), since I'm using sklearn and creating new interfaces to the classes, I think this chat would be better. So... how do you guys organize the entire project folder? Also, do you use Pipelines, if so, wqhere do you place all the different transformer?
