<s> <user> hello , just wondering , how can we setup path dependant input states for random forest ? this is similar to <unka> network , where input <unk#a(,=> ... <unka,> , .. <unk#a-> , <unk#a-> ) depends on past output states yt . if we could put the exact output states yt , it creates a bias in the training . so , wondering how we can put <unka> states in random forest training . thanks </s>
