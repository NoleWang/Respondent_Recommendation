[00:49] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> thanks :)
[11:50] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> Why do we have the `_check_cv` function? It is called by `check_cv` which does nothing additionally? Am I missing something? https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/cross_validation.py#L1431
[12:11] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> It should be removed... I opened a PR #4829 for that... Please review @vene @amueller ! :)
[12:11] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> and @ogrisel
[21:54] <54e07d6515522ed4b3dc0858> @amueller can `sklearn.utils.testing.ignore_warnings` ignore *specific types of warnings*?
[21:54] <54e07d6515522ed4b3dc0858> the code looks odd
[21:55] <54e07d6515522ed4b3dc0858> (this is in reference to #4824)
[22:31] <54e07d6515522ed4b3dc0858> so have we decided to just never use the words "extreme learning machine" in docstrings/documentation?
