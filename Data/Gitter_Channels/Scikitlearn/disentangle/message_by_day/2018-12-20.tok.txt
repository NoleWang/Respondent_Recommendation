<s> <user> hi , sorry if this is a silly question , very new to svm in general . was wondering if it 's possible to create a model for <unka-> <unka> ( ie . training on normal data , testing on normal and novel data ), where there are more than 2 features for each example . all the code i 've seen online seem to only consider 2 features </s>
<s> <user> those are <unka-> minimal examples mostly for presentation purposes . i 've applied <unka> to <unk#a+> features and have gotten good results . i guess that answers the question :) you may find the " learning with kernels " book useful if you decide to get deeper into the topic . </s>
<s> <user> also if you interest is novelty detection , do n't restrict yourself to <unka> . you should also give <unka> and lof a try : URL/https:/ <unka-./> <unka./_> </s>
