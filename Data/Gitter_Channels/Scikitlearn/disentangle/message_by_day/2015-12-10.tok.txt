( so we can filter <unka> for review like " need review " and !" action needed " ) </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> 2 of my <unka> also need reviews , you think they need to be tagged ? </s>
<s> <user> " need review " of course ;) could you list them here ?? </s>
<s> <user> nevermind ! <unka@> <unk##> , <unk##> </s>
<s> <user> and awesome you 've fixed <unk##> ... sorry i tried and gave up ... </s>
<s> <user> that 's ok , that issue still has n't been fixed , though . i was making a mistake by not passing <unka_> , but there is no reason why that test should fail </s>
<s> <user> should we tag all " <unka> " ones with " needs review " ? </s>
<s> <user> i was wondering that ... but that would be too much ... so i was thinking maybe we could have only 20 odd <unka"`> <unka"`> tags at a time ? how does that sound ? </s>
<s> <user> we have at most 10 serious <unka> right ? </s>
<s> <user> the number of <unka*[`> issues are over 150 </s>
<s> <user> i tagged all of them , but we should <unka> those that actually wait for the person doing the review to get back </s>
<s> <user> well how do you choose the 20 ? </s>
<s> <user> by most recently commented ... </s>
<s> <user> how does that make sense ? </s>
<s> <user> if someone created the perfect pull request and no dev reviewed it for 2 years , then it will be never reviewed </s>
<s> <user> well rules are meant to be broken ... :p we could have 10 more for such <unka> ? or not ... probably that was a stupid suggestion ... nevermind ;) </s>
<s> <user> but there will be a question on how do we get to decide that 10 probably .. so its better that all <unka*[`> is " need review " tagged ... </s>
<s> <user> we should remove the ones where we are waiting on the contributor to address comments </s>
<s> <user> okay that sounds better :) if i catch something like that i 'll just ping u here ... and how about <unka"`> <unka"`> for stalled <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> that is the same as pr ;) </s>
<s> <user> haha ... i mean like <unka-> <unka> ;) </s>
<s> <user> ? </s>
<s> <user> for example in [ this <unk#a#(-./:]> ) the author of <unk##> said that he is not working on it anymore ... there are quite a few <unka> like that and a few more where the author has stopped responding ... i was wondering out aloud if we could tag those with <unka"`> <unka"`> ... </s>
<s> <user> or close them ? </s>
<s> <user> well how do you know if something is stalled and what would be the benefit of the tag ? </s>
<s> <user> that is better ... but i feel it should be done only for stalled <unka> which have a related issue open and we should include a comment in the issue that " there was a stalled pr <unk#> that was closed due to inactivity " ... but i am afraid that closing might be a bit rude ? </s>
<s> <user> i was thinking of doing a random search from time to time ;) </s>
<s> <user> for comments by authors saying so or comments which ask for status that go <unka> for more than a month ... </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> is <unka> <unka> with you ? </s>
<s> <user> ah no why ? </s>
<s> <user> do you know who he is ? </s>
<s> <user> he is in paris , right ? </s>
<s> <user> i met so many people at the sprint . </s>
<s> <user> right you are with alex . hm ... </s>
<s> <user> ah he was sitting with us ... but i am unable to <unka> who he is ... </s>
<s> <user> hehe ok </s>
<s> <user> any dutch :p ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> <unk#a@> in <unka> we have " pr : author 's turn " . it is put once the pr is reviewed and we are waiting on the author to address the comments . this way it is sometime easier to identify stalled one 's . <unka:> : </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> <unka-> <unka> might also be interesting : <unk##> </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> the <unka-> stuff here <unk##> would be cool but is likely to be a bigger project </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> how often do you reassign them ? if the pr is quite active , it changes often who 's turn it is . or do you only do that if it is stalled for a while ? </s>
<s> <user> it might be helpful </s>
<s> <user> i have seen it to work best : 1 . it is a big pr . reviews take time . 2 . author replies in a while . probably not a good idea when the pr is quite active . works well for slower one 's . </s>
