<s> <user> hi all , i want to revisit the question regarding how to interpret the output of <unka_`> something meaningful . with the output from <unka_`> , how can i determine if a prediction is trust worthy or not , given some threshold <unka`> ? </s>
<s> <user> there is no generic method , it depends on your <unka> and the kind of <unka> reduction used by the underlying model ( e.g . one vs one for <unka> , one vs all for most other models such as <unka> ). </s>
<s> <user> you might also have <unka> prediction errors : some regions of your feature space might lead to a higher error rate and this <unka> might not be part of the model assumptions ( or maybe cannot be handled properly by the model capacity ). </s>
<s> <user> which model family are you interested in ? one interesting thing to consider is using a calibrated <unka> ( especially for binary <unka> ): URL/http:/ <unka-./> <unka./> this way you can better interpret the output of <unka._`> . this wo n't solve any <unka> issues though . </s>
<s> <user> what you can also do is plot the precision recall curve , select an <unka> precision level ( e.g . 0.8 ) according to business considerations and select the model and threshold that maximizes the recall at that precision level . we currently do n't have a high level api to do this but the URL/http:/ <unka-./> <unka./_> function of <unka-> returns the <unka> for each point along the pr curve . </s>
<s> <user> once you have fitted your best model , you can compute its precision and recall on a held out test set to check that this is still fine , and further analyse that you do n't have strong <unka> in your precision recall metrics . for instance if you use your <unka> to build a <unka> systems for users , you can check that you get approximately similar performance for various ways to split your user base , e.g .: male vs female users , age groups , <unka> , very engaged users vs casual users ... </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thanks olivier <unka:> : i 'll give it a try </s>
<s> <user> i am doing facial recognition , so it 's <unka> </s>
<s> <user> you should definitely try to label your test dataset with additional info such as facial hair , glasses , long hair vs short air , gender , maybe <unka> so as to compare the accuracy of your model for different groups of people . </s>
