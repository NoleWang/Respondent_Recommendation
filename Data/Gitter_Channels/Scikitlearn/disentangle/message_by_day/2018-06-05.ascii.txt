[16:37] <5b11caa3d73408ce4f9b96b5> @kelux19  I don't think so there is any api to scikit-learn in c#. But you might want to wait for others' answers as well.
[17:30] <5b11caa3d73408ce4f9b96b5> I'm using  a custom tokenizer for the TfIDF. I trained the model and saved the pipeline object to a pickle file using joblib. However, when I try to load the pickle file in a different script, it throws an error: module '__main__' has no attribute 'MyTokenizer'. Am I pickling the model correctly ?
