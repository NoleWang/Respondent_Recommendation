<s> <user> if you truly want to dynamically " stop growing a cluster " based on custom criteria , i do n't think any of the <unka-> algorithms have an api for that . moreover , it would only apply to algorithms that incrementally grow clusters , e.g . hierarchical clustering . if your dataset is not huge and you do n't need to fit many different models , you could try implementing your own hierarchical clustering with simple python logic , and add your own constraints . it 's a fairly straightforward algorithm . </s>
