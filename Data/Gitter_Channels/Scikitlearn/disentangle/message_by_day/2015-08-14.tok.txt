<s> <user> i 'll give it a ( hopefully ) final review this afternoon :) </s>
<s> <user> hi , how could i preview the html generated by rst file ? </s>
<s> <user> open <unka./_> in your browser :) </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thanks !! </s>
<s> <user> thanks <unk#a@> </s>
<s> <user> after <unka`> ? </s>
<s> <user> thanks . i got it . </s>
<s> <user> after make in the doc folder </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> there are no changes to <unka/> or <unka/> in <unk##> . did you forget to push or something ? </s>
<s> <user> oh , wait , i thought you merged URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> and URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> but you did n't ? </s>
<s> <user> the built at URL/http:/ <unk#a./> <unka-./_> does n't seem to be using the documentation change branch ? </s>
<s> <user> i 'll review <unk#a#-/> now , but it would be good to have a built of it </s>
<s> <user> 2 mins ! :) </s>
<s> <user> sure :) </s>
<s> <user> it should be updated now !! how did you detect it was not updated ? ( asking so i could check that part of doc and see if it reflects the change :) ) </s>
<s> <user> well there were no changes in the <unka-> part ? </s>
<s> <user> it still had the header <unka-> and was referencing <unka*._> </s>
<s> <user> ohh okay ! now its fixed :) </s>
<s> <user> and yes i did n't merge URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-./> i only merged URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> since i got a +1 from yourself and vlad ... do you suggest that i merge URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> too ? </s>
<s> <user> well i wanted to give it a final pass as a whole . but i 'll review the 4 now on its own </s>
<s> <user> i can help </s>
<s> <user> thanks <unka@> . i think the main question on <unk#a#-/> is whether to keep the old stuff in the references </s>
<s> <user> and whether to " fix " the references in the <unka> ( loads of <unka-> otherwise ?) </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thanks !! <unka> with all 3 of us online ... its getting merged by today i suppose ;) :d </s>
<s> <user> i'd actually like at least one more feedback on keeping the old methods in the references or not . </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> did you do " make html " in the doc folder to run all the examples ? that should n't give any <unka> warnings wrt the move </s>
<s> <user> same goes for running the tests . the old classes should be tested , but all <unka> should be caught . </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> does <unk#a#-/> include the example fixes ? </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> are you around ? </s>
<s> <user> 2 mins ... the make html takes a looooong time :( </s>
<s> <user> i know ;) </s>
<s> <user> did you fix the other examples , though ? </s>
<s> <user> if so , you should push ... </s>
<s> <user> example fixes were merged into <unk##> </s>
<s> <user> cool </s>
<s> <user> and the doc pr was <unka> on top ? </s>
<s> <user> yea :) </s>
<s> <user> of <unka_`> branch which includes example fixes .. yes :) </s>
<s> <user> the <unka_> branch does n't include the fixes yet . </s>
<s> <user> they are not in the pr </s>
<s> <user> something got screwed up <unka:> : now i deleted the merged branch too :/ will have to redo the work ... give me a few mins ... its quite trivial only ... </s>
<s> <user> yay i was able to recover it as a patch from [ <unk#a(-./:]> ) :d </s>
<s> <user> with git , things are rarely truly lost </s>
<s> <user> :) </s>
<s> <user> also , have a look at the <unka> command </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> sorry i gotta run . i 'll continue reviewing tomorrow </s>
