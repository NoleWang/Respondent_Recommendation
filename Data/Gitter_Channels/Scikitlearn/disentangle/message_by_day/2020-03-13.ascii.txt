[14:31] <5e6b96b3d73408ce4fdca2f0> Hello, I wanted to write a usage-question on github, but the issue tracker brought me here. I have a multilabel problem which i want to solve with a RandomForestClassifier. But I have so much data that I use a dataloader and a random forest with warmstart: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/327335/batch-learning-w-random-forest-sklearn . But I get an error after I fitted the model multiple times and try to predict testdata with multilabels. I broke it down to a minimal example (which fails too), but when I fit data, which i created with make_multilabel_classification, in one go the prediction of the random forest works. Any ideas?
