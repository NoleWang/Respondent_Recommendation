[08:46] <5baf7d9ad73408ce4fa9c9b2> I'm not sure what you mean by best model. There's no notion of best model, only one model is built. If you mean "model with the lowest training loss" that's basically the model at the last iteration,  under the assumption that the training loss is always supposed to decrease (unless your learning rate becomes too high). If you mean "model with the lowest training loss that doesn't make the validation loss go up", that's what early stopping is supposed to give you (and it's preferable to the former)
