[18:15] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> @amidvidy maybe open an issue that states that the documentation is not clear enough on how to use `sample_weight` an `precompute` together. Maybe we could add a new dedicated section to the user guide and reference that section from the docstring for the precompute parameters of those models.
