<s> <user> <unka@> just did <unk##> </s>
<s> <user> thanks </s>
<s> <user> another question for the developers . it seems that <unka._`> is lacking an option to pass a 2d numpy array of strings or objects . it seems that it 's impossible at the moment . it would be nice because at some point someone might need to do text <unka> and cleaning on another tool such as <unka> or spark and be able to dump that as 2d numpy array in order to further analyze . </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> i 'm not sure i understand the usecase . you want several separate <unka-> and have each <unka> separately ? or together ? </s>
<s> <user> apologies for not clearly explaining the usecase . let 's say that our dataset is like this : <unk`> x = <unka'(.[> is a text' ], [ 'the brown fox jumped over the <unka'> ], [ 'this is a longer string for just <unka> an <unka'> ], [ <unka'> text here' ], ... ]) <unka.> = ( 1000 , 10 ) <unk`> each sample or row from <unka`> creates a vector representing the bag of words . each vector is of variable size because it depends on the length of the sting a.k.a how many times a word is present in the string . one could pad with zeros all of those vectors in order to have the same dimensions . ideally it would be nice to give <unka`> to <unka._`> ` and get back a matrix <unka_`> <unka.> = ( 1000 , <unka)`> where <unka`> represents that each row vector in <unka_`> has the same length . is that a bit more clear ? </s>
<s> <user> sorry , what 's the 10 in your example ? is each example a single string or multiple strings ? </s>
<s> <user> the 10 is the number of columns and each of them may or may not contain multiple <unka> </s>
