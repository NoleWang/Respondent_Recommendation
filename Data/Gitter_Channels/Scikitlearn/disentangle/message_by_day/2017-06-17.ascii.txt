[06:40] <57433a8cc43b8c6019747d9e> Hi all, So we have 25 images of dimension 400X488. We have labels assigned to each image as 1/0 . There are 14 1s and 11 0s. What we need to do is we need to find pixels that differentiates 1 from 0. Also along with these differentiating pixels we also need to allot ranking to them based on their frequency in images with label 1.  Any thoughts on how to do it?
