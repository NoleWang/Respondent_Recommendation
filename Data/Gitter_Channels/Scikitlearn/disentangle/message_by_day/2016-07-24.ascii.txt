[08:09] <564789be16b6c7089cbab8b7> hi... has there been any work in incorporating minhash to help cluster large sets of documents?
[08:15] <564789be16b6c7089cbab8b7> also.. in this very highly cited paper "Clustering Large Graphs via the Singular Value Decomposition" http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/vempala/papers/dfkvv.pdf the main algorithm is to take a random submatrix (suitably chosen) to make the SVD computation feasible. Has this been proposed at all for sklearn?
