What does ranking pixels mean? Why do you want to do that in the first place? Is this a natural image classification problem? In that case you will need much more than 25 labeled images to do anything useful as I already told you earlier. If those are not natural images then you should probably give more details on the nature of the images. Which objects are in the images? What are the two labels 0 and 1 (what do they mean)? Have the images been recorded with a traditional camera with three color channels or is it a very specific recording device?
