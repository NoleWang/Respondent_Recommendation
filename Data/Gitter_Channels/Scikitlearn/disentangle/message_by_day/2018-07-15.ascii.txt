[20:31] <589b9e0fd73408ce4f490ba4> Anyone interested in a reviewing a PR on PyPy support ?  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11010 it's mostly a CI setup + very light changes to make tests pass .. Maybe @lesteve ? :)
[20:37] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> I gave my +1
[21:01] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> FYI I disabled the lgtm webhook (or tried to?) because it's confusing for the sprinters

[21:33] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> does anyone know what happened here? https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11504
[21:33] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> there's something funky going on with the pooling_func deprecation
[21:39] <5b4a4873d73408ce4fa0e326> @amueller 
[21:39] <5b4a4873d73408ce4fa0e326> @amueller  When I post a future warning, am I to assume we are  currently on version 0.20 of sci-kit learn?
[21:40] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> @annaayzenshtat right
[21:40] <5b4a4873d73408ce4fa0e326> ok, thanks!
[21:41] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> @amueller It seems it was done on purpose
[21:41] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/commit/b4561f09e6e0ff8a2e16f09be21b3202012bbdd7
[21:41] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> fixed in #11537
[21:41] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> it's unused in agglomerative clustering but not feature agglomeration which inherits the fit...
[21:42] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> oh right
[21:44] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> (and that's why I don't want deprecation warnings in the examples and tests ;)
[21:57] <5b4a4873d73408ce4fa0e326> @amueller  When I do a pull request, should it be against the master branch?
[21:58] <55d21ee30fc9f982beadabb8> It should be against master
[21:58] <5b4a4873d73408ce4fa0e326> thanks!
