<s> <user> hi <unka@> , thanks for wanting to contribute ! have you read the contributor 's guide ? i would suggest you look for issues tagged " good first issue " . many of those are multi-part issues where you can pick just a part to work on </s>
<s> <user> see URL/https:/ <unka-./> <unka./> and URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a%-/> for good first issues </s>
