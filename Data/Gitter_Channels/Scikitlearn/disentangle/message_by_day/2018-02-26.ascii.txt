[09:19] <572f08a2c43b8c601971bc45> Hello, I am considering applying for a [GSoC project](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/SAGA-sparse-linear-models) with the aim of adapting the SAGA algorithm for R, possibly by porting existing code from scitkit-learn. The project, however, needs another co-mentor and I am wondering if there is any scitkit-developer here that would interested in participating? You can message me directly or contact Toby, who is signed up as mentor.
