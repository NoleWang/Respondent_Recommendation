<s> <user> hi everyone , i'd like to compare different <unka> for <unka> feature selection . currently <unka-> provides <unk#a> and <unka_> but i'd like to use others like document frequency , <unka> and <unka-> separation too ( here is a <unka> study URL/http:/ <unka./> <unk#a)./> i 've already written a <unka> implementation of <unka> but according to the <unk#a> documentation ( URL/http:/ <unka-./> <unk#a#./_> ) it seems that it should return the <unka> scores along with an array containing the <unka_> of each feature . how should i <unka/> that <unka_> ? </s>
