<s> <user> are there any plans to allow <unka> to customize their expected precision for your <unka> checks ? the checks are great , but i 've found that <unka> i have fail because of precision issues ( like a single element of a 60 element array being off by <unk#a-> ). it would be nice to be able to at least have some rough measure of precision as an <unka> attribute that the tests could then use to adapt their behavior . </s>
