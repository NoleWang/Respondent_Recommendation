<s> <user> could be wrong but my impression is that we mostly use the word dummy to denote " something designed to resemble and serve as a substitute for the real or usual thing ; a <unka> or sham " ( taken from google definition ). that might not be true in the case of <unka/> , where the name might come from the fact that these <unka> are over simplistic . though the previous definition could also hold for them . idk . changing their names will force lots of users to change their code though , so it 's not just going to be an internal change . as a side note we also have a bunch of " sanity checks " , deemed <unka-> by twitter , and i 'll admit i 'm quite puzzled by this one </s>
