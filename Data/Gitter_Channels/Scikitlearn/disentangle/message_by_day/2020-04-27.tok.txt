<s> <user> hi all , what 's the reason why one should n't set other attributes during construction in <unka> <unka> apart from those in the <unka_`> signature ( see <unka> check : URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a#)-./?_> if i understand it correctly , <unka`> calls the constructor and so all other attributes will also be re-set . </s>
<s> <user> <unka`> does n't call the constructor with the expected parameters . the parameters are set in <unka_`> . that means if setting some other attributes depends on some given attribute to <unka_`> , and that logic is not duplicated in <unka_`> , the constructor would be in an invalid state . putting those in <unka`> makes them all consistent . </s>
<s> <user> but there are ways where you can handle it with setting other parameters in <unka_`> , and the <unka> not going into an invalid state , if you know what you're doing , then you can ignore that test . </s>
