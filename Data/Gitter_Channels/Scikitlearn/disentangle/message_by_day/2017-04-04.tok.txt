<s> <user> a curious observation : <unk`> from <unka._> import <unka> v = <unka(> ) <unka"(,.[> " ]) <unk`> the result is <unk`> <unk#a<> sparse matrix of type <unka'<> <unk#a'.> > ' with 0 stored elements in compressed sparse row format > <unk`> it seems that <unka> will transform any single word into zero vector . do i miss anything ? </s>
<s> <user> look like the default " word " analyzer will transform single character into empty list <unk`> analyzer = <unka(._> ) <unka"(> " ) <unk`> <unk`> [ ] <unk`> </s>
