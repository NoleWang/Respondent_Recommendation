<s> <user> <unka@> could you please paste a fully reproducible piece of code ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@_> we get quite a bit of these requests these days ( which is a good thing , shows people are looking into issues ). but it would help people decide if they want to spend time on it , if you give a tiny bit of intro on what it is . also , feel free to send an email to the mailing list with that information if you want to reach more people . </s>
<s> <user> sure , i was n't sure whether this falls under advertising . we are looking for open source contributors who are willing to talk to us about how security and trust are handled within their <unka'> communities . this is the landing page with more info : URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> ah interesting . i do n't think we do much of that in this project , but others may think differently . </s>

<s> <user> the aim was to perform <unka-> <unka> and <unka> probability scores for each ( label , profile ) pair . nb : y was encoded wit h <unka> </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> please provide a minimal reproducible piece of code , that is a piece a piece of code that we can just copy and paste in a python shell or python script and run to trigger the problem . here the code you provide does not include the definition of <unka_`> and <unka_`> which is probably the core of the problem . using minimal random data from <unka(.=_> , <unka_> ) or <unk#a(.=> , <unk#a=> , <unka=_> ) </s>
<s> <user> and also add the necessary code to <unka> <unka_> and the code that <unka> the cross validation with the score you want . </s>
<s> <user> minimal stands for removing anything that is not necessary . for instance are <unka> <unka> necessary to reproduce the problem ? or can you just reproduce the problem by cross validating the base <unka> directly ? if so simplify the code snippet . </s>

<s> <user> i do n't understand why you are using <unka`> here because <unka`> is already a binary representation of the target variable since in this snippet you used <unka_`> . please provide a snippet that causes the same error message as the problem you observe with <unka-> <unka> <unka> score . anyways by reading the <unka-> documentation URL/https:/ <unka-./> <unka#-./_> i do n't see how this would work for binary encoded <unka> data . </s>
