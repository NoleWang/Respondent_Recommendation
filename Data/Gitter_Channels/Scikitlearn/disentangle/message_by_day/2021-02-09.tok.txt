<s> <user> i have a general question : if for my dataset a <unka> <unka> works well ( compared to e.g . <unka> and random forest ), are there other <unka> that might also work equally well ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> stuff based on distances then </s>
<s> <user> can you give some examples ? </s>
<s> <user> hi everyone , i am not certain if this is the right place to ask . i am a first-time contributor . i love the library and it has helped me immensely in my studies so far . i was hoping to work on this issue as my first issue : URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> as far as i can understand , this issue requires that the documentation be updated , does that indicate the <unka> within the function definition only , or is that referring to another piece of documentation ? one of the <unka> on the issue also mentions ensuring there are tests that break if this documentation does n't exist , how do i go about doing that effectively ? </s>
