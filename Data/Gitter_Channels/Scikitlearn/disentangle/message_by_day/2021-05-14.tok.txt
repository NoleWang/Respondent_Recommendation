<s> <user> well you need to define what are your feature variables and the target variable . so for instance you could try to predict the position from all the other variables . <unka> would be taken into account depending on the model . so for instance if your model is linear the target would be a linear combination of the features . if you do have a known <unka> relation between your variables it might be easier and more reliable to use <unka.> or <unka.> to find the <unka> you would like to learn though . </s>
<s> <user> thanks for your answer , i forgot to mention that i fit my data with kde and i sample new <unka> from this model . is this model keeping the correlation between the different variables ? or it assumes the variables are independent from each other ? thanks again ! </s>
