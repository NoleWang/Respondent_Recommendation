<s> <user> hello ! for the last 2 weeks of the <unka> program , i was thinking of helping to address <unka> 's backlog of <unka> ( e.g . by doing code reviews ). does anyone have any recommendations for how best to approach that ? ( searching through the backlog , <unka> <unka> , leaving some types of <unka> for core maintainers , etc .) </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> reviewing is always welcome and it 's a great way to learn ! the things i personally look for during a review are : - backward compatibility and consistency with the current library ecosystem . - test coverage . ideally we want tests to be fast as well . - docs : every new feature should be documented at least in the ug . big ones ideally come with a new example - code clarity and comments : you want your future self to be able to understand why something was done the way it was done in terms of where to find <unka> to review , we have a " waiting for <unka> " tag . also you can try filtering by <unka> which already have one approval : these might be easier to review . feel free to review old <unka> but note that there 's a chance these will never be addressed . </s>
