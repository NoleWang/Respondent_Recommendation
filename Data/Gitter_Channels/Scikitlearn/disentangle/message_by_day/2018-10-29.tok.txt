<s> <user> <unk#a@_> well , i guess i mean for <unka> regression . linear scaling <unka> should not have a direct impact for most models and methods . i think the linear scaling will just factor out of everything . of course , it might help with numerical stability if the target has extreme values . basically , intuition is that for regression methods , min <unka(> ) - y is same problem as min <unka(> ) - <unka\> * y but with a modified x . for example , you could just scale the weights of the last layer to get the different y . with sgd or whatever method you are using to solve , you could of course get different results with scaled y . this is not a proof of course ... just found this : URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a#-/> which is potentially a good <unka> of the details . </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> hi , i dunno i jumped in recently without even asking anything :). seems like a mix of questions from people starting and a few technical discussions . ( human ) latency is pretty high . just try to help people who are stuck if you know some answers to questions i guess . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thanks ! i thought there might be some prerequisites . </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a@> wanting to contribute . python and ml knowledge is helpful ;) </s>
<s> <user> start with the contributors guide and " good first issue " tag if you want to start helping </s>
<s> <user> and yes , review latency is terribly high unfortunately </s>
