<s> <user> the second question i had is the following - in my field the requirement is that the nearest neighbors search for a particular grid point of say 2d data must be include contributions from above and below the surface in question . supposing i have three <unk#a-> surfaces . top and below the current surface . then i do a radius of influence query for the three surfaces separately . the <unka> value for the grid point in the current surface must include contributions from all three surfaces from above and below the current surface as well as the current surface </s>
