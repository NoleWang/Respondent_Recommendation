<s> <user> hi , i am the " maintainer " ( more like <unka> ) of <unka> ( which was split out of <unka> a couple of years ago ); i tried moving the ci to azure and realized that the macos tests were failing ( previously testing was only done on linux ( travis ) and windows ( <unka> )) but ca n't test locally on macos , would anyone be willing to have a look ? URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a/=?_> thanks ! </s>
