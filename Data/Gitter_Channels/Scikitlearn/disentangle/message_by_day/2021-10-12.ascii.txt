[09:45] <5cdeaebed73408ce4fc08df3> Hello I'm using scikit-learn `0.22.2.post1` and getting the following error  ` AttributeError: '_CalibratedClassifier' object has no attribute 'classes_' `when I try to use `predict_proba`on calibrated classifier  Do you you know if this issue is related to the scikit-learn's version ? Thanks

[15:50] <5c9a8be3d73408ce4fbbe82f> Is cohen kappa score and balanced accuracy score supposed to work w/ multiclass labels?  I have a 3-class classification and I'm trying to use `cross_validate`, but it returns nans for all my scores. I tested the problem by running `cross_val_score` on all scores individually and isolated it to those 2 metrics.  X = (100, 5) y = (100, 3) clf is a Random Forest Classifier ``` from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score  cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='balanced_accuracy') ```
