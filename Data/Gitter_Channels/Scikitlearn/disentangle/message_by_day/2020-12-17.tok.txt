<s> <user> hi all , i implemented a new feature for <unka> mixture models and i 'm wondering whether it would be useful to have it integrated in <unka-> . should i open an issue to discuss this or can it be discussed here ? in brief , i implemented the mixture entropy <unka> ( lower and upper bound ) introduced in this paper URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a./> </s>
<s> <user> hi <unka@> , please have a look at our inclusion criteria : URL/https:/ <unka-./> <unk#a#%-./=?> </s>
<s> <user> hi <unka> , thanks for that , so if i check , i get : * [ x ] 3 years since <unka> : ( 2017 ) * [ ] 200+ <unka> : no , 57 at the moment . * [ ?] wide use and usefulness : this is a bit arbitrary . * [ ?] clear cut improvement : for some settings ( in particular with larger no . of features and no . of <unka> components ) using those bounds gives more efficient and more accurate entropy estimation than using a <unka> carlo sampling approach ( which can be done with the <unka.> method ). by seeing this would you say i should open an issue to discuss this on github or just leave it ? </s>
<s> <user> colleagues : looking for best practice tips to get logging output from <unka> , in particular from <unka> clustering where im having trouble figuring out how to use <unk#a=`> ( parameter doesnt seem to exist on <unka.`> nor on the <unka().`> method ) have reviewed lots of issues on the subject but unclear current status of logging context managers or similar . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> we do n't have any logging . the verbose is only printing on the stdout . </s>
<s> <user> we are currently looking at improving this part with a real logging system </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thank you for the prompt response . i dont see a way to get *any* output from <unka> . am i missing something ? </s>
<s> <user> there is no such parameter for a <unka`> </s>
<s> <user> indeed the <unka> does not anything during <unka`> apart of storing the dataset </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> i'd probably open an issue to discuss it . my gut feeling is that it does n't pass the inclusion criteria , but it'd be nice to also here what other maintainers think on the issue tracker </s>
<s> <user> hey folks <unconvertable > want to talk with you about pipelines <unconvertable > </s>
<s> <user> what is the use case they were created to cover ? </s>
<s> <user> in most of the examples , people groups processing " branches " by feature types ( <unka/> ) </s>
<s> <user> is this the main use case pipelines were designed for ? </s>

<s> <user> these three stages are the main in my data processing flow . </s>
<s> <user> so ideally i would like to process data in the same order in the pipeline as well . then it would be converted naturally to pipeline definition </s>
<s> <user> so i would imagine a pipeline definition like this : <unk`> <unka([> ( <unka'_> , <unka([> ... <unk),]> ( <unka'_> , <unka([> ... <unk),]> ( <unka'_> , <unka([> ... <unk),]> ]) <unk`> </s>
<s> <user> however , this does n't work , because <unka_> step would return me numpy array which is hard to work with on the following stages </s>
<s> <user> in the same time , my data processing has <unka> ( <unka_> step requires all values in place ( <unka_> ) and <unka_> requires all set of features ( <unka_> )). there are also operations i could apply on a multiple columns ( and would love to do ) like " none " constant <unka> or <unka> encoding and single column specific actions like <unka> <unka> </s>
<s> <user> please let me know if all of this makes any sense </s>
<s> <user> with that being said , i 'm wondering what is the cleanest way to define <unka> pipeline for this task ? </s>
