[12:28] <5684304216b6c7089cc0a229> wait, are you really getting zero division warnings from TestGMMHMMWithTiedCovars::test_fit_zero_variance (which is the failing test on osx)?  I get only get warnings on TestGMMHMMWithDiagCovars::test_fit_zero_variance (another test)
[13:25] <5decf929d73408ce4fd36f72> Dear, I i tried to tune hyperparameters of scikit GradientBoostingRegressor model using the Hyperopt optimizer. I set search space for learning_rate parameter in the range [0.01, 1] by many ways (for example : ""'learning_rate': hp.quniform('learning_rate', 0.01, 1, 0.05)"" or as simple array ""[0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.1]"") but when I run the code hyperopt start to calculation and I get the error " ValueError: learning_rate must be greater than 0 but was 0".  I do not know what is problem in the code because zero value is not in the parameter's scope. How zero value come to function?  Please help me to solve this problem.
