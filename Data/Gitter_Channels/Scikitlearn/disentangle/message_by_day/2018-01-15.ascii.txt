[00:19] <54b2524adb8155e6700e8a8e> @gxyd, try `np.set_printoptions(threshold=np.inf)` rather than `np.nan`, or perhaps `np.set_printoptions(threshold=np.iinfo(np.int).max)`
[00:24] <54b2524adb8155e6700e8a8e> @thechargedneutron, our problem with GSoC is assuring mentor availability, as well as developing well-defined projects and students we are confident will complete the work without too much hand-holding. We have much less core dev availability than a few years ago, and many fewer well-defined, coherent project options that do not require substantial expertise. For example, we have a few big API things that could do with attention (see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/projects/9), but they mostly require a lot of familiarity with Scikit-learn API design issues. At this stage of maturity we have less need for an <unconvertable> implement this kind of algorithm <unconvertable> or <unconvertable> optimise that <unconvertable> kind of project. If a compelling student/project candidate approached, I think we would consider it.
[05:51] <58b47262d73408ce4f4d4113> @jnothman  Thanks for the reply. I am indeed interested in working in API things but need a good understanding of it. Since there's some time before the GSoC, I would like to orient myself in the direction of the current requirements. Can you advise me on how to acquaint me with the current issues and possible solutions. Thanks :smile:
