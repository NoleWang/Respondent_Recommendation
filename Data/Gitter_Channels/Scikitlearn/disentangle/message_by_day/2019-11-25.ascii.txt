[19:58] <5acfdfffd73408ce4f95738d>  When using "random forest" and "gradient boosting". I add to the main signs, a sign that in the picture. [title](https://ibb.co/997YpMK) The data is clearly not stationary. To make the series stationary, I apply a one-time difference to the data(increments) After all, I normalize the data. [title](https://ibb.co/6tbdVzJ) Why, if I don't use increments(one-time difference), then classes are separated better? [title](https://ibb.co/dBJrnDf) Although in all textbooks they write that non-stationary data should be decomposed into increments. For training, I use the first 5000 characters. If you pay attention to the data, extreme values start after 5000. That is, the model does not even see that such large values were in the training sample.
