<s> <user> <unka@> ( this is probably a stupid idea ), can we compute the accumulated <unka_> for all the samples and store it . ( a double array of <unka_`> size ) later we can compute the <unka> <unka_> for right or left by <unka> the last index 's accumulated value from the first ? ( would that speed up the <unka> computation and also take us a step closer to having a <unka-> <unka> ?) </s>
<s> <user> ( there is also the class count that is being stored as a state , that also could be accumulated and stored but not sure if it would take up a lot of space .) </s>
<s> <user> ( also we need not compute this accumulated <unka_> for all the samples , we could expand this <unka'> when we encounter new samples to avoid computing for samples well away any decision boundary ?) </s>
