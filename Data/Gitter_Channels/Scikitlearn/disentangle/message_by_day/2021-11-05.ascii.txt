[17:54] <61856d766da037398489e910> Hi folks! I have a very simple fix for https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/12052 that only addresses this issue for CalibratedClassifierCV. I know SLEP006 seeks to fix this for the general case, but it appears to still be a WIP. Is it worth me throwing together a PR to simply add the groups parameter to CalibratedClassifierCV with checks to ensure the cv supports it? I've tested this out on my own by subclassing CalibratedClassifierCV and writing a modified fit method. It's essentially a 2 line code change. I'm happy to submit a PR if it seems likely this will be accepted?
