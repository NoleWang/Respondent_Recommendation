[14:22] <5e7de2b6d73408ce4fde36e6> I came across this on Twitter today and it made me think that scikit-learn also uses the word "dummy": https://twitter.com/wimlds/status/1279635475825754112 It would probably be good to move away from using this word (Google is trying to do the same btw: https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#dummy-variable), however it would be a big undertaking. A search for this word in scikit-learn gives me 479 results. I just wanted to point this out and ask what you think about it.
[15:30] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> I guess we could call the `Dummy{Classifier/Regressor}` a `Trivial{Classifier/Regressor}`?
[15:47] <5eeb997bd73408ce4fe7491d> in some testing files like `sklearn/cluster/tests/test_hierarchical.py` and `sklearn/gaussian_process/tests/test_gpr.py` the comments refer to creating dummy data and dummy optimizers but don't use the dummy classifier or variables. Maybe a good first step would be to change the wording in these comments as it doesn't conflict with the code?
[19:12] <5baf7d9ad73408ce4fa9c9b2> is dummy offensive?
[19:34] <567f5d7716b6c7089cc043a8> I looked up why it's offensive, and it seems most people think it is or may be offensive because of the way it's use as a derogatory term to call somebody stupid or an idiot. Now if we think of the people whom unfortunately are called often dumb or stupid by their friends or colleagues while many of them being very talented, we realize why the term may be a trigger for them. I personally don't find it offensive in the context which is used in our library, but general rule of thumb is that if there are many reasonable people out there who thing something is offensive, then it's offensive to them and I should avoid using the term, if that makes sense.
