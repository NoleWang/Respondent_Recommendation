[20:31] <5d5565e0d73408ce4fc880d5> Is there a scikit-learn preferred way to store a vector using Cython?  I've seen libcpp.vector, array.array and numpy used in the code base.  @NicolasHug @amueller 
[20:33] <5baf7d9ad73408ce4fa9c9b2> The way we do it now is to allocate numpy arrays (in python or in cython), and then use a memory view for pure cython parts. You can take a look at how we do it in e.g. `ensemble/_hist_gradient_boosting`
