[19:25] <5e3f3d7cd73408ce4fd915a4> Hi all, I am working on revamping the [Keras](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/keras) [Scikit-Learn wrappers](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/wrappers/scikit_learn.py). This essentially requires implementing the entire Scikit-Learn API supporting multi-outputs, etc. I think I got everything working just by reading the API reference, but I would like to see if any of the Scikit-Learn developers are willing to take a look at the implementation and give me any pointers on things that might be issues. For example, it is not clear to me if ensembles of multi-output estimators are supported, and other edge cases of that nature. The PR is [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/37201) if anyone wants to take a look. Thank you!
