[06:42] <5730c2dcc43b8c601971eca1> Hello, Just wondering, how can we setup path dependant input states for Random Forest ? This is similar to Recurrent Network,   where input Xt=(x0,...,xi,.. yt-1, yt-2) depends on past output states Yt.  If we could put the exact output states Yt, it creates a bias in the training. So, wondering how we can put  recurrent states in Random Forest training. Thanks
