<s> <user> <unka@> this looks like a bug indeed . i do n't have a quick fix from the tip of my head but could you please open an issue on github to avoid forgetting about it ? it 's probably a temporary buffer that is assigned with an <unka.`> instead of <unka.`> in our <unka> code or wrapping python code . </s>
<s> <user> here is a similar bug we had in the past ( a long time ago ): URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> ideally a pr would be appreciated because none of us will be able to reproduce it because we do not have access to such hardware . </s>
<s> <user> also if you want to submit a pr for our doc that documents how you cross-compile <unka-> for <unk#a> , that could be useful knowledge to share . for instance it could be a new section at the end of this page : URL/https:/ <unka-./> <unka./_> </s>
