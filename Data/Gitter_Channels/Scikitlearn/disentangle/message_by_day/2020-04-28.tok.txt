<s> <user> thanks for the quick reply , yes , so , as long as there is no logic or interaction of attributes in <unka_`> , i can initialise other attributes in <unka_`> . we are developing a toolbox that extends <unka> to time series and currently have an <unka_`> attribute in our base <unka> which is initialised to <unka`> , any reason why this may be a bad idea ? </s>
<s> <user> that 's just a bad idea cause we have a <unka_`> utility function which should be used ;) </s>
<s> <user> i know , i find having an <unka_`> state cleaner than following the <unka-> convention :) thanks for the help </s>
