<s> <user> hi all ! we're working on a generic implementation of a discrete time survival model for random <unka> . similar to [ <unk#a(-./:]> ) and [ <unk#a(-./:]> ). basically , the idea is to split on hazard curves which are a bit like the class <unka> of regular <unka> random <unka> but then <unka> per duration since inception of an observation . we want to use <unka-> for a base . is anyone here familiar with the random forest code ? also tips for a good pr are very welcome . </s>
