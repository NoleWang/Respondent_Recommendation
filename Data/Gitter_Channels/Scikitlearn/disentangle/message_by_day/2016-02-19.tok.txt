<s> <user> why does <unka_> give better accuracy than the predict function ? whats the difference ? </s>
<s> <user> what are the best parameters for <unka_> when performing <unka> on svm ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> wohoo </s>
<s> <user> i 'll try to answer your question in a few minutes when i return to a computer . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> as for your second question , it really depends on your dataset . could you describe it ? </s>
<s> <user> for <unka_> vs predict , theyre two completely different methods . <unka_> <unka> the probability of your input being a certain class . predict returns what class the model <unka> your input to be ( e.g . by taking the class with the highest probability from <unka_> ) </s>
<s> <user> does that make sense ? </s>
<s> <user> ( if anyone else wants to clarify correct validate my explanation , please do ) </s>
<s> <user> <unka-@> that makes sense . from my understanding , <unka_> does the same thing as predict but it requires a <unka> value to activate in case of binary outputs . it still doesnt explain why it gets better results </s>
<s> <user> im not sure what you mean by <unconvertable > get better results . are you doing binary <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> yes ... i get <unk#.> score with predict and <unk#.> score with <unka_> </s>
<s> <user> how are you getting a score with <unka_> ? shouldnt it output an array with 2 elements ? </s>
<s> <user> it does , but i slice the output and use the one that gives a true value . </s>
<s> <user> so to verify , you slice the output , find out which has the highest probability , and use that as the predicted , correct ? what class are you using for <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka> regression and gradient boosting <unka> </s>
<s> <user> hmm how are you using two ? </s>
<s> <user> i tried both separately just to see which produced a better result and noticed that <unka_> gave a much higher accuracy in both cases . </s>
<s> <user> should that always be the case ? im always discovering new techniques that completely invalidate everything else ive learned . </s>
<s> <user> well generally the way predict works it that it takes the <unka> generated by <unka_> , and then chooses the most likely one </s>
<s> <user> so they should be the same . </s>
<s> <user> i feel like that shouldnt be happening haha but i have no <unka> evidence to back up my claims . would you mind letting me see your code to ensure there are no random bugs ? </s>
<s> <user> <unk`> encoder = <unka(.> ) <unka(.> , <unka_> ))) x = <unka(.> ) <unka_> = <unka(._> ) # <unka> <unka> = <unk#a(=> ) <unka(.> , y ) <unka_> = <unka().[_> :, 1 ] df = <unka'(.{> : <unka.> , <unka'> : <unka_> }) <unka(.> ) <unka'(._> ) <unka#> about <unk#.> <unk`> </s>
<s> <user> why do you slice [ :, 1 ]? </s>
<s> <user> maybe theres some <unka> magic going on that im not familiar with , but if you slice [ <unk#,:> ] arent you always getting the <unka> of the second element of <unka._> ? is there some way that you check whether this is greater than or less than the probability of the other class , and then put the correctly labeled prediction into the df ? </s>
<s> <user> that way i select the column with a probability of 1 . </s>
<s> <user> this is more magic than science to me . </s>
<s> <user> one quick question : is it possible that <unka> give worse score accuracy ? i get <unk#.> off the bat on an svm implementation but i get about <unk#.> with the best parameters from <unka> . </s>
<s> <user> its possible that you might not be controlling for randomness between grid search and if you do a train test split or something . you should set a consistent random seed to ensure <unka> . </s>
<s> <user> ( in response to your previous comment about selecting the column with probability 1 ) hmm thats not how it works . lets say you have a model that takes in inputs x , y and you want to predict whether these inputs belong in a or b from it ( binary <unka> ). if you call <unka(,[_> <unk),]> then it would output an array with the <unka> that the input [ x,y ] is each class , e.g . <unka(.[> <unk#,.> <unk).]> </s>
<s> <user> lets say the output of <unka._`> is <unka,[]`> . this would indicate that the input vector you fed in ( <unka,[]`> ) has a 40% chance of being something of class a , and a 60% chance of being something in class b . </s>
<s> <user> i see what you mean but choosing the column with the highest true positives means you can immediately compare with null accuracy and decide whether to improve sensitivity of <unka> . </s>
<s> <user> what do you mean highest true positives ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka> a correct value of true . eg <unka> > 0.5 when the real value is 1 </s>
<s> <user> in my <unka> problem , if i just predicted 1 everytime , i would be correct 94% of the time . </s>
<s> <user> one of the two columns , [ x , y ] would have more 1s . when i slice , i use that column for <unka> . </s>
<s> <user> oh . is that just an <unka> feature of the dataset ? so basically you want to predict based on some sort of confidence ratio ? e.g . you know its most likely 1 , so predict 1 every time unless theres a very high confidence for 0 ? </s>
<s> <user> what do the two columns [ x,y ] represent ? </s>
<s> <user> they represent whether a user is granted access permission or not </s>
<s> <user> no sorry i mean is [ x,y ] the input , the result of <unka(_> ), etc ? </s>
<s> <user> its the result of the <unka_> </s>
<s> <user> when you have the return result of <unka(_> ), the confidence of 1 is in one column and the confidence of 0 is the other . you cant really pick out <unconvertable > which column has more ones ? </s>
<s> <user> ( on that note , the reason why <unka(> ) and <unka(_> ) are different is because of the way youre using <unka(_> ) is not the same as how <unka(> ) would generate labels for your input vectors ) </s>
<s> <user> you certainly can . simply print out the first x elements of both columns and youll see a pattern immediately . </s>
<s> <user> i see what you mean . </s>
<s> <user> when you print out the two columns , do you get 0s and 1s .. ? </s>
<s> <user> the 0s and 1s are <unka> and are assigned to one column each </s>
<s> <user> i get <unk#.~> </s>
<s> <user> ok , that seems fairly reasonable . i feel like the reason you see a pattern is simply because 95% of your dataset is labeled one haha . </s>
<s> <user> exactly ..... going through the trouble of <unka> that extra 1% is insane . </s>
<s> <user> then why even bother using ml if you could just always guess <unk#`> and be right 95% of the time ? </s>
<s> <user> tell that to <unka> </s>
<s> <user> oh its a <unka> competition ? would you mind sending me the link . that may help me explain haha </s>
<s> <user> URL/https:/ <unka./> <unka-/> </s>
<s> <user> getting my feet wet ..... my head is spinning .... most of this is just trial and error . </s>
<s> <user> hmm if you want to get your feet wet , id suggest <unka> on <unka> . this is a pretty good tutorial URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unka-/> </s>
<s> <user> but regardless , <unka(_> ) doesnt work the way you think it does . taking one column and encoding everything as that only happens to work because a large portion of your dataset is one label . </s>
<s> <user> i did that one .... was pretty helpful . the employee challenge and <unka> rabbit challenge prepare you more thoroughly for real world ml problems </s>
<s> <user> did you use <unka(_> ) in <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> its probably best to just stick to using <unka(> ) and further tuning your model performing feature selection </s>
<s> <user> its just a coincidence in this case that <unka(_> ) seems to work so much better than <unka(> ) </s>
<s> <user> from what ive gathered so far , tuning features is tedious and not usually worth the hassle unless you have like a 100 features . </s>
<s> <user> thats not always true haha . feature engineering is quite important in the real world to distinguish signal from noise in data . </s>
<s> <user> e.g . if you wanted to predict whether an employee has access and you were given information about their salary , working hours , and favorite place to eat lunch on <unka> campus . this is only 3 features , but its quite evident that where they eat lunch on <unka> campus likely has no correlation is not related to whether theyd have access . </s>
<s> <user> actually thats not necessarily true , maybe there are more high scale places reserved for <unka> or something but do you see my point ? </s>
<s> <user> youre probably right . thats where <unconvertable > domain expertise <unconvertable > or just plain old common sense comes into play . </s>
<s> <user> yup . </s>
<s> <user> beyond that , feature engineering in terms of normalization and other <unka> on the data can also be quite useful to do things like remove <unka> , etc . </s>
<s> <user> youre absolutely right . have you tried <unka> ? its awesome .... i wanna learn more about <unka> . they produce high <unka> right off the bat . </s>
<s> <user> in URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> i am confused by which <unka> is having its hyper parameters optimized in the examples with graphs . does anyone know ? </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> if you happen to be about i think this question is aimed at you :) </s>
<s> <user> if your possible target classes are consecutive integers like <unk#[`> , 1 , <unk#]`> the <unka()_`> should return the same as <unk#a().=_`> . <unka_`> is just a way to ask for the confidence levels of the model when it 's making a prediction . the final <unka> decision should be exactly the same . </s>
