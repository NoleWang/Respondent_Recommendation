[08:09] <5e16d36cd73408ce4fd62604> **Curious To Learn & Contribute To Scikit-learn At The 'Paris Scikit-learn Sprint Of The Decade' | Jan 28 - 31, 2020**  It was quite insightful listening to Reshama Shaikh's recent podcast: https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-banana-data/bdn-15-finding-community-in-uK-yL2tf_S4/  It was quite helpful to broaden my horizon and perspective on open-source when I learned the challenges the organization faces in finding the sponsors and fundraisers for scikit-learn sprint events.  As an avid user of scikit-learn for my research projects in the recent past, Im excited about the potential of contributing and working alongside other attendees at the Paris scikit-learn sprint. Reshama's comments about funding & accessibility have made me even more eager to join the team.  Would you all mind letting me know if I could connect with the other participants remotely from Bengaluru, India?  Best, Sandeep Aswathnarayana
[09:25] <5c8bb176d73408ce4fbac89c> @SandeepAswathnarayana, sprints are meant to allow people to meet in person, remote participation is not planned. There will be other sprints I'm sure you will be able to attend. In the meanwhile, thanks for your enthusiasm... if you check the contributors guidelines (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html) you could probably start helping already.
[13:53] <5e16d36cd73408ce4fd62604> @cmarmo, Thanks for reverting to my query. I was aware of the already existing ways to contribute. I was only curious to see if I could be a part of the scikit-learn sprint which allows me to do 'Pair Programming' with individuals from diverse backgrounds attending the event.
[14:00] <5e16d36cd73408ce4fd62604> @cmarmo, Any leads or inputs on future possibilities for remote participation are greatly appreciated. Thank you!

[17:44] <5e1765c2d73408ce4fd6356c> hey folks. I have started my Data Science journey. In the process of completing the DataQuest online Data Science bootcamp . Is SciKit Learn & specifically Auto Sklearn a good set of tools to learn to help accelerate my journey and on the way to becoming an expert?
