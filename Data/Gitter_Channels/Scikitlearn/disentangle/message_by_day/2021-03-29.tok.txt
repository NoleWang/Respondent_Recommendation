<s> <user> hi everyone , i am a developer who 's trying to test multiple models in different frameworks . i just want to know if this idea makes sense - i want to create a single <unka> pipeline script for testing various models ( all mapped to the <unka-> interface or using <unka> ). but from what i understand is that models are not just plain <unka> or <unka> . the models are a combination and <unka> pipeline does n't apparently support it . is my understanding correct ? is this a futile effort ? can someone please help me out with this issue . thank you . if there 's an alternative , please let me know . i 'm talking about object detection models . i really like the pipeline <unka/> and would like to extend my models to match the same <unka.> , <unka.> interface </s>
