<s> <user> <unka@> i was reading the <unka> of the <unka-> and i am wondering if what is written is not very misleading </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> i would have to read the code to check , but i was very confused with the <unka> , so i googled and i arrived on stack exchange : URL/http:/ <unka./> <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> to me , the <unka> suggests that the code actually does p linear regressions , and looks for the significance of the parameter ( usually , this is done by converting the <unka-/> ), but it mentions and <unka-> and <unka-> which is usually used to compare nested models </s>
<s> <user> disclaimer : i have no clue what i talking about :d </s>
<s> <user> so i think the stack exchange link is misleading as well . </s>
<s> <user> in the specific case of <unka-> 's implementation , the <unka-> and <unka-> are identical ( as we are comparing one model to the null ), so it indeed boils down to selecting the features that are significantly correlated with the target . if the <unka-> features are selected , it is exactly what sure <unka> screening is about </s>
<s> <user> hi everyone . i have a problem that i would love to solve with <unka-> , but cant seem to figure out how to crack it . im hoping someone who knows a bit more about the package might have a quick answer . i have a matrix <unka$> that i want to <unka> with sparse <unka> as <unka$> = <unka$> . i would like to use <unka-> to tune the <unka> ( to wit , level of <unka> and # of components ). since the only place that <unka$> shows up in the objective function for <unka> is <unka$-_|> , i would imagine doing the cross validation in random <unka> , each time leaving out a random subset of the elements of <unka$> from the <unka> norm , fitting the model , and then computing the <unka> error on those elements . however i cant seem to find any way or think of a trick to do the fit on just a subset of the matrix ( <unka-> <unka> algorithm doesnt seem to like it when i try to <unconvertable > leave out <unconvertable > some of the elements by setting them to <unka`> :-p ). is there any other route to accomplishing this within the package ? </s>
