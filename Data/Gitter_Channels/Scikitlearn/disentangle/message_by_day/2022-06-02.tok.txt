<s> <user> > if that 's true then this is an undesired behaviour for me as a user . i want things to be explicit and not implicit like this spending hours searching to find what 's going on ? <unka> will always be the best but this is not possible with regression . so we stated in the <unka`> argument doc and the user guide as well : > when the cv argument is an integer , <unka_> uses the <unka> or <unka> strategies by default , the latter being used if the <unka> <unka> from <unka> . one should improve the documentation to make it explicit for the default <unka`> and add <unka_`> together with <unka_`> . </s>
<s> <user> > on an additional note i do n't understand the phrase in all other cases , fold is used ., so in the case of my example instead of using <unka> is <unka_> implicitly using just fold ? oh actually this is already documented properly . <unka`> is a typo , it should be replace with <unka`> and link to the cv splitter . </s>
