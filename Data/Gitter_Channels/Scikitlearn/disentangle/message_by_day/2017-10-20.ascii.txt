[15:55] <56d2f977e610378809c40828> Hi, a recent ML enthusiast trying to contribute. I just forked the scikit-learn repo and got a very easy PR merged. 
[16:00] <56d2f977e610378809c40828> I set up a dev environment using virtualenv, so that it does not interfere with my existing scikit-learn installation. But I see that the docs does not mention it at all. Is there any particular reason? Or am I missing something obvious here?
