This doc presents how to browse the issue tracker to find issues to tackle. Ideally, it's best to start with a small issue or improvement to an estimator class or function that you use yourself on a regular basis.
[07:43] <541a528b163965c9bc2053de> @amueller  yes but Remy does not work at Amazon :) I remembered that scaleway had an ARM-based cloud and it could have been useful to better support scikit-learn on ARM but it's no longer the case apparently.
