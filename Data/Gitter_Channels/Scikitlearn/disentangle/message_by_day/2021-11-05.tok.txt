<s> <user> hi folks ! i have a very simple fix for URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> that only addresses this issue for <unka> . i know <unk#a> seeks to fix this for the general case , but it appears to still be a wip . is it worth me throwing together a pr to simply add the groups parameter to <unka> with checks to ensure the cv supports it ? i 've tested this out on my own by <unka> <unka> and writing a modified fit method . it 's essentially a 2 line code change . i 'm happy to submit a pr if it seems likely this will be accepted ? </s>
