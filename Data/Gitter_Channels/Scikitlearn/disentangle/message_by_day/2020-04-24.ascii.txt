[10:07] <581f1608d73408ce4f33fcaf> hello, would adding the `return_std` argument to the `predict` method of the lightgbm regressor class be enough to plug it into scikit optimize? Also what kind of stdev is it referencing to by `std(Y | X)` ? I tried to look how it is added to the estimators provided by the skopt but it appears it is done in different ways for all of them so it is not clear to me..
