<s> <user> i am trying to use <unka.> on the audio files from URL/https:/ <unka./> <unka./_~> by <unka-> lee . these have been referenced in prof . andrew ng 's old lectures on independent component analysis . the <unka> does not seem to work with <unka> . all the code examples that i could find mix simple <unka> like sine , <unka> with a simple mixing matrix and try to recover it back . does any one have any insights on this ? </s>
