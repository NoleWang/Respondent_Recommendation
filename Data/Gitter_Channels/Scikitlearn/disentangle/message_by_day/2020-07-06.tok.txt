<s> <user> i came across this on twitter today and it made me think that <unka-> also uses the word " dummy " : URL/https:/ URL/twitter.com/ <unk#a/> it would probably be good to move away from using this word ( google is trying to do the same btw : URL/https:/ <unka./> <unka#),-/> however it would be a big undertaking . a search for this word in <unka-> gives me <unk#> results . i just wanted to point this out and ask what you think about it . </s>
<s> <user> i guess we could call the <unka/`{}> a <unka/`{}> ? </s>
<s> <user> in some testing files like <unka./_`> and <unka./_`> the comments refer to creating dummy data and dummy <unka> but do n't use the dummy <unka> or variables . maybe a good first step would be to change the wording in these comments as it does n't conflict with the code ? </s>
<s> <user> is dummy offensive ? </s>
<s> <user> i looked up why it 's offensive , and it seems most people think it is or may be offensive because of the way it 's use as a derogatory term to call somebody stupid or an idiot . now if we think of the people whom unfortunately are called often dumb or stupid by their friends or colleagues while many of them being very talented , we realize why the term may be a trigger for them . i personally do n't find it offensive in the context which is used in our library , but general rule of thumb is that if there are many reasonable people out there who thing something is offensive , then it 's offensive to them and i should avoid using the term , if that makes sense . </s>
