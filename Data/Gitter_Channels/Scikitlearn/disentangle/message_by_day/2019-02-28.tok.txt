<s> <user> <unka@> a minimal example copypasta would be helpful to get us started ; usually its as simple as you described <unka(`> x : <unka()`> assuming all records in the loop are independent </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a-@> this is the loop im trying to work with <unk`> for pair in <unk#a(,:[]_> ): x1 = <unk#a[> ] x2 = <unk#a[> ] <unk#a(,._> ) <unk`> </s>
<s> <user> it might make more sense to do something like this <unk`> import numpy as np from <unka> import combinations def <unka(_> ): return <unka(.> ) <unka_> = <unk#a(.> )) <unka_> = <unka(._> , 2 ))) <unka_> = [ <unka(_> ) for pair in <unka_> ] <unk`> since the biggest performance boost is likely to be from simply using <unka> data structures ( re : URL/https:/ URL/stackoverflow.com/ <unk#a)-/> </s>
