[06:46] <5395efa3a9176b500d1cd7fb> looks like the dataset for the scipy2015 tutorial sessions is not coming down? http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip download does not start.
[06:46] <5395efa3a9176b500d1cd7fb> im using the fetch_data script in your github repo.

[13:24] <53135b495e986b0712efc453> @jonoleson I am unable to gauge how useful that usecase is...

(But IMHO that particular usecase seems simple enough to not warrant a plotting helper function!)
