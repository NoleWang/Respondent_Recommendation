[05:49] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> I'm currently getting some errors in my scikit-learn branch (made some changes). Running tests via pytest, produces some output on terminal, but since numpy arrays contains large number of elements, they are printed with a threshold. ``` $ pytest sklearn/metrics/tests/test_common.py ============================================================= test session starts =============================================================  sklearn/metrics/tests/test_common.py:917: in check_averaging     y_pred_binarize, is_multilabel) sklearn/utils/testing.py:311: in wrapper     return fn(*args, **kwargs) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  metric = <functools.partial object at 0x7fa62c5d5b50> y_true = array([0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0,   ...0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0,        1, 1, 2, 0]) y_pred = array([0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2,   ...0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0,        2, 0, 1, 2]) y_true_binarize = array([[1, 0, 0],        [0, 1, 0],        [1, 0, 0],        [0, 1, 0],       ...0, 0],        [0, 1, 0],        [0, 1, 0],        [0, 0, 1],        [1, 0, 0]]) ``` Now the problem is how can I print the complete array's (i.e with `threshold=np.nan`).  I tried to put `np.set_printoptions(threshold=np.nan)` in concerned test file as well as in skearn/utils/testing.py but with no success. Do I need some pytest option?
[05:50] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> See here `y_true` is printed with some threshold size.
[06:10] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> Well, one thing I can do is, use the `print` statement and then use `pytest` with `-s - v` option. But I don't think this is a good solution.

[14:51] <55fc44590fc9f982beb11bbf> #10443 Ready to MRG, needs review. 
[17:22] <58b47262d73408ce4f4d4113> Is scikit-learn going to take part in GSoC 2018? If yes, I saw a couple of projects in GSoC 2017 wiki. Since, there were no participant last year, is that project list still valid or are you guys going to come up with some other projects? I would be willing to explore available/possible projects.
