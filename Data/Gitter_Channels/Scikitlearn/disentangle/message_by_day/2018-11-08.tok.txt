<s> <user> <unk#a@> you need to find the appropriate kernels from <unka._`> and construct the equivalent kernel to construct your <unka> matrix for the gp . i have n't looked into them to know if there 's a one to one mapping between the old ones and the new implementations . alternatively , you can try and construct the solution to your usecase from scratch using tutorials such as : URL/https:/ <unka-./> <unka#-./_> </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> in less than two weeks we're going to have a <unka> for people who are new and interested in open source development . i 'll be introducing them to <unka-> 's development process , for which it 'll be nice to have the <unka/> labels updated . the main issue which also troubles myself whenever i 'm looking for something to work on , is that the " help wanted " labels are very rarely removed from the issues once they're put there . going through the first 25 issues tagged with " help wanted " , only 7 actually really need help , and for most of them there 's already an open pr to fix the issue . i 'm not sure how it can be improved in a <unka> way , but it'd be nice if somebody could update the labels at least for now :) </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> i second that . </s>
<s> <user> is there any proposed date for this ? <unka@> ? </s>
<s> <user> this is our <unka> : URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a/> </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> thank you for taking time to respond . i was thinking the same think that you're suggesting but i ca n't find any <unka`> kernel in the list of available kernels : <unk`> > > > <unka._> . <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unka(._> <unk`> </s>
<s> <user> a question for the developers , how can someone add a custom kernel to <unka> process , i have custom method but keep getting error when adding it directly do we need to wrap it with some base <unka> because it complains about the <unka_`> method </s>
<s> <user> <unk`> ( pdb ) <unk#a(.> , 3 ), <unk#a(.> )) *** typeerror : cannot clone object <unk#a'(.[> , <unk#.> , <unk#.> , <unk#.> , <unk#.> , <unk#.> , <unk#.> , <unk#.> , <unk#.> , <unk#').]> ( type <unka<> <unka'.> > ): it does not seem to be a <unka-> <unka> as it does not implement a <unka'_> methods . <unk`> </s>
<s> <user> i guess this is still an issue URL/https:/ URL/stackoverflow.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
