<s> <user> hi ! i want to ask here before bothering people on github : is there a reason for the <unka> import structure of <unka> ? i often find myself importing only to have to search for the <unka> name of a thing i already know . for example , i might need " <unka> " , but i wo n't remember that it is under " <unka> " . is it worth having each collection of functions and classes under their own module ? granted , there are many <unka> , each containing many more things to import , but surely maintaining a list of imports at the top level of <unka> would n't be too big of a hurdle , so that <unka`> <unka> import <unka`> would be possible . it would be a huge usability boost in my humble opinion . but i might also be dumb . am i missing something obvious here ? cheers ! </s>
<s> <user> i 'm not a big fan of heavy import statements , and having all those classes and functions as a top level import would make " import <unka> " very very heavy ( since it would load every <unka-> api immediately ). also , sometimes there may be conflicts between modules . other than that , i find the code more readable and understandable when imports are from the <unka-> instead of a top level import . </s>
<s> <user> oh that 's true ! i do n't really have a grasp on the full scope of <unka> , so i can imagine the import could be huge . i 'm quite satisfied with this being the main explanation . thanks a bunch ! </s>
