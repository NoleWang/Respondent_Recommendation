[09:13] <53232ac75e986b0712efe3af> Are you sure you installed the development version?
[09:14] <53232ac75e986b0712efe3af> It seems as you are building the master docs but with a released version of sklearn for running the examples
[09:14] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> Well that is what I thought initially.
[09:15] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> But how can I force I make it to use the development version.
[09:15] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> Would I need to modify the `PATH` variable?
[09:17] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> I get things like ``` /home/gxyd/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_search.py:docstring of sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV:166: WARNING: Undefined substitution referenced: "param_kernel|param_gamma|param_degree|split0_test_score". /home/gxyd/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_search.py:docstring of sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV:166: WARNING: Undefined substitution referenced: "...". ``` While running `make html` which made me inclined towards the thing you are saying.
[11:12] <53232ac75e986b0712efe3af> @gxyd I typically have a 'development' environment in which I install the master version (with `pip install -e .`)
[11:16] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> As I can see for `-e` option: ``` Install  a  project  in editable mode (i.e.  setuptools "develop               mode") from a local project path or a VCS url. ```
[11:58] <53eb987c107e137846baa89d> @jorisvandenbossche thanks. That seems to be working just fine for me right now.
