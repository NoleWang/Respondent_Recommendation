<s> <user> dear , i i tried to tune <unka> of <unka> <unka> model using the <unka> optimizer . i set search space for <unka_> parameter in the range [ 0.01 , 1 ] by many ways ( for example : "" <unka'_> : <unka'(._> , 0.01 , 1 , 0.05 <unk")> or as simple array <unk"[> 0.01 , <unk#.> , <unk#.> , 0.1 <unk")]> but when i run the code <unka> start to calculation and i get the error " <unka> : <unka_> must be greater than 0 but was 0 " . i do not know what is problem in the code because zero value is not in the parameter 's scope . how zero value come to function ? please help me to solve this problem . </s>
