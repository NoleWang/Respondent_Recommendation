<s> <user> hi everyone , i 'm a graduate student at <unka> and i had a paper ( URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a./> ) published a while ago in correcting the bias of feature importance in <unka-> methods . <unka-> feature <unka> can be misleading for high <unka> features ( many unique values ), which is already noted in the <unka> of <unka_> in <unka> . i just opened a new pull request <unk##> to implement a new feature importance measurement based on <unka-> samples , which is guaranteed to remove this bias . i think this feature is going to be useful for <unka-> users . any comments or suggestions will be helpful ! </s>
