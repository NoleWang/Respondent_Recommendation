<s> <user> hey guys . i 'm dealing with an older version of <unka> ( <unk#.> ) ( not able to upgrade at the time ) where the class attribute <unka_`> for <unka.`> object is used instead of <unka_`> . so where i'd have <unka'_`> : <unka'([> , <unka'> ], <unka)=`> in my fitted svm object , how would i replace that with <unka_`> ? simply exchanging the key names does n't do the trick . i get the error message : <unka`> mismatch , expected <unk#a'_> but got python <unka`> . if you guys could help me figure this out , you're be even more awesome than you already are . </s>
