[06:11] <598aa547d73408ce4f70a1d1> I recently built a rudimentary classifier that identifies the news topic of a given article. I scraped lots of news articles - as training data - off a website, with their labels. In terms of text-processing, I removed stopwords, punctuations, lemmatized all words, then computed the tf-idf values of the remaining words. I represented each article as a doc of its 25 words with the highest tf-idf values. Then I decided on adopting a knn approach to the problem: upon getting the input article and determining its most frequent words (after the text-processing), I find the 5 articles that have most words in common with the input article - and then I perform a majority vote. If a majority of the 5 articles are tech, then the input article is tech. What are some ways I can improve upon this approach?
