[02:18] <58d1e48dd73408ce4f52af1b> The second question I had is the following - in my field the requirement is that the Nearest Neighbors search for a particular grid point of say 2D data must be include contributions from above and below the surface in question. Supposing i have three 2-D surfaces. top and below the current surface. Then I do a radius of influence query for the three surfaces separately. The interpolated value for the grid point in the current surface must include contributions from all three surfaces from above and below the current surface as well as the current surface
