[13:34] <5474d9eadb8155e6700d8178> spectral embedding doesn't accept lists... Should that be considered an issue?
[21:21] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> the function or the class?
[21:38] <5474d9eadb8155e6700d8178> the `fit` method I had meant
[21:40] <54d4a1d6db8155e6700f853b> are you sure? That should be a common test. It might be that the common test doesn't cover clustering yet. Then this should be fixed.
[21:43] <5474d9eadb8155e6700d8178> Yes `SpectralEmbedding().fit([[1, 2]])` doesn't work... Ok I'll fix it and add tests for that...
