<s> <user> thanks <unka@> . i saw how <unka> does things , it 's somewhat similar to how <unka> is doing things now . an alternative i thought of that i wanted to get feedback on is to have the user define ( 1 ) <unka_`> and parameters for this model and ( 2 ) a <unka_`> function that is expected to return an instance of a <unka> <unka`> . so a user defined model would look something like : <unk#a`> class <unka(> ): def <unka(_> self , <unka=_> , ): <unka._> = <unka_> def <unka(_> , x , <unka_> ): model = <unka.> ... return model <unk`> </s>
<s> <user> where <unka_`> would have access to all of the <unka> attributes in addition to variables like <unka_`> and <unka/`> which <unka.`> passes if they exist in the signature of <unka_`> . </s>
