[12:42] <53fdba59163965c9bc200ba2> Hi. Reading the SVC doc(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html) has it `... may not work properly in a multithreaded context `  Is possible to execute SVC using all threads? how ? 
[14:27] <56c625c3e610378809c22760> Hi, I'm trying to build an outlier detection system on textual data using the `EllipticEnvelope`. I was wondering if there's a better way to choose the optimal number of features out of a TFIDF vectorizer so as to not cause a memory error or a singular covariance matrix apart from repeatedly checking on the training or the cv set. Thanks a lot for the help and I apologise if this is a very noob-ish doubt!
[19:07] <53fdba59163965c9bc200ba2> How can I see the most frequent word using a TfidfVectorizer instance? Is possible?
