<s> <user> hello everyone , i have a very specific use case designed around <unka-> and wanted to see if it was possible to code it up . the overall idea is to train a 1d embedding using a <unka> <unka> . for this , i take a <unka> <unka> <unka> model trained using <unka(-> is given and persay has been trained on 50 features ), i want to add a new feature to it i.e a random variable x DIR/~/ <unk#a(> , 1 ) and <unka> the model to get a 51 parameter model . once this is done , i treat the input x as a parameter , freeze the model and get optimal value for <unka_> using gradient based approaches . finally , upon having the optimal set of <unka_> , i want to <unka> end to end using all 51 features . this is the gist of the algorithm that is designed . any leads towards apis or whether this is <unka> or not would be really helpful . thanks ! </s>
