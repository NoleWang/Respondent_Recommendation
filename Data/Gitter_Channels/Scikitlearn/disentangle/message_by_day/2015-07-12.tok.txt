<s> <user> <unka@> what do you think about the placement on the <unka`> argument in <unka_`> and the like ? </s>

<s> <user> i 'm curious about the [ <unka> ] convention i see being used on pull requests . does that just indicate that the author believes it 's ready to merge ? </s>
<s> <user> i think i wrote a good test for pr <unk##> . i <unka> before because i thought it would be weird to test something that should be somewhere around 0.5 . but then i taught myself about <unka_> . </s>
<s> <user> it was fun <unka> with some of you , i 'll be back on later today or this week to hopefully finish that <unka-> example . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> exactly ! it 's a way for <unka> to tell at a glance what state a pr is in . </s>
