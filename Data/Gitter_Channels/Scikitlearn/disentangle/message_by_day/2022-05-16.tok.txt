<s> <user> hi everyone , i 'm new in this community and i want to apologize in advance for any errors i might make in asking the following question . so , i have to implement a <unka> task using <unka-> for a big dataset ( 84 feature x 2,5 <unka> of <unka> ), processed like a stream . after many and many attempts my code finally run without warnings or errors but there is a problem : i am using the class evaluate <unka> and its methods for the <unka> and , by setting <unka> metrics to evaluate the goodness of this <unka> , i obtain very high values for each metric used . this is " strange " considering the dataset i am working on , reason why i want to generate the confusion matrix in order to understand on wich classes my <unka> algorithm works better and on wich classes it makes more <unka> . generating confusion matrix is very easy using <unka-> , but this method needs to have as input parameter true labels and predicted labels and here is the problem : i cannot isolate from evaluate <unka> , in particular from the method " evaluate " , predicted labels , consequently i have no way to generate the confusion matrix because i have not predicted labels to make a comparison with true labels . for sure there is trick to get around this problem but all of my attempts since two days failed and i have no more ideas on how i could do it . please , do you have an idea on how to solve this problem ? thank you a lot . </s>
