[14:08] <5baf7d9ad73408ce4fa9c9b2> @mtsokol it seems that you're doing it right... maybe double check that 1. you're actually changing the sources, i.e. not anything in the _build folder, 2. the doc that you're changing is about a public estimators/tools (private tools aren't rendered in the doc anyway) and 3. that you're looking at the generated html in `doc/_build/html/stable/`
[14:14] <5baf7d9ad73408ce4fa9c9b2> @MrAE   re 1. you can't use (let alone allocate) numpy arrays when the GIL is released because these are Python objects. Is there a way for you to allocate the arrays somewhere where the GIL is held, and use memory views when the GIL is released? Memory views are safe to use without the GIL  re 2. is it still considered a Python object if you use a `cdef`ed class and all the attributes are `cdef`ed as well?  re 3. what vectors? can't you use a view as a field of the struct?
