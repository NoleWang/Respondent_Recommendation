<s> <user> when using " random forest " and " gradient boosting " . i add to the main signs , a sign that in the picture . [ <unk#a(./:]> ) the data is clearly not stationary . to make the series stationary , i apply a one-time difference to the <unka(> ) after all , i normalize the data . [ <unk#a(./:]> ) why , if i do n't use <unka(-> difference ), then classes are separated better ? [ <unka(./:]> ) although in all <unka> they write that <unka-> data should be <unka> into increments . for training , i use the first 5000 characters . if you pay attention to the data , extreme values start after 5000 . that is , the model does not even see that such large values were in the training sample . </s>
