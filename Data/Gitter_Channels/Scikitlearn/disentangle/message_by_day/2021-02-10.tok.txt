<s> <user> > i have a general question : if for my dataset a <unka> <unka> works well ( compared to e.g . <unka> and random forest ), are there other <unka> that might also work equally well ? i think it will depend on the data set . it also depends on how you are <unka-> your data . so kinda hard to say without knowing more . </s>
