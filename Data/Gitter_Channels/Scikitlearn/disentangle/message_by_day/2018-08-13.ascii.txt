[23:06] <57957e3e40f3a6eec05c4d2a> Hey guys. I'm dealing with an older version of sklearn (0.13.1) (not able to upgrade at the time) where the class attribute `_label` for `svm.SVC` object is used instead of `classes_`. So where I'd have `'classes_': array(['compatible', 'incompatible'], dtype=object)` in my fitted svm object, how would I replace that with `_label`? Simply exchanging the key names doesn't do the trick. I get the error message: `dtype mismatch, expected 'int32_t' but got Python object`.  If you guys could help me figure this out, you're be even more awesome than you already are.
