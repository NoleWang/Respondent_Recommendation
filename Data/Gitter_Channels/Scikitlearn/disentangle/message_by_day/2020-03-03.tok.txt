<s> <user> can we use an <unka> algorithm to perform sentiment analysis ? if no , how to extract dataset on the customer support conversation <unka> ? as i dont' have any dataset i looking for <unka> model please let me know how to proceed ? </s>
<s> <user> hi <unka@_> it depends from what you need ... which kind of sentiment analysis would you like to perform ? through <unka> models you could in theory <unka> the conversations , and for this i'd suggest to have a look to bag of words techniques , <unk#a> , <unk#a> , etc . but i think you need to classify the conversation following some criteria that exploits the sentiment , right ? in this case i do n't see any alternative to a <unka> <unka> . and like any <unka> problem , find a godd training dataset it 's not trivial at all . but anyway , i'd be open to any further suggestion that could come from this chat . hope it helped anyway . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> i am looking for happy unhappy ( or positive <unka/> ) criteria <unka> . i have searched for the customer support conversation <unka> , but i did not got any <unka> . i have searched in <unka> and google . let me know if any other repository for such <unka> </s>
<s> <user> <unka@_> have a look on <unka> package : there should be some basic implementation based on word 's semantics ( i.e . it extracts single words and check the presence of generally negative terms like " is n't " , " are n't " , etc .). </s>
<s> <user> but , again , it strongly depends from what you define " positive " or " negative " in your sentiment analysis . in most cases , you need <unka> approaches , and generally you need your own labeled <unka> . machine learning stops to be nice at the moment you realise you need to label your <unka> by your own :) </s>
