<s> <user> hi , i am using <unka> with <unka> for <unka> metric , however when i do cross validation with <unka> , an error is raised saying that the dimension of the metric is not correct . the code is like this : <unk`> from <unka.> import <unka> <unka_> = <unka(> ) <unka> = <unka([> ( <unka'> , <unka(> )), ( <unka'> , <unka(> <unka'(=> ), <unka=_> <unk)]> <unka> = <unka(> , <unka=_> , <unka=> , <unka=> , <unka=_> , <unka=> , <unka'=_> ) <unka(._> , <unka_> ) ... <unk`> may i ask what may be the problem ? in case it is not supported , is there other ways to corrected scale targets in <unka> ( as well as <unka> , etc .). thank you very much ! </s>
