[09:05] <5860d0cbd73408ce4f3f55a5> why do we use random numbers in machine learning ?
[09:06] <5860d0cbd73408ce4f3f55a5> I don't quite get it 
[10:30] <5c667cfad73408ce4fb7e11a> @Devosource there can be many uses of random numbers. For example if you are working on a dataset of a hundred thousand images and you need to check the result randomly, then you might use a randInt() function i guess.   Also, that was just an example. I didnt quite understood the context of your question. Hope you got your answer but if not then you could be more specific and someone would give you the answer you are looking for.
[15:26] <5860d0cbd73408ce4f3f55a5> i was going through keras beginner's tutorial and abit of CNN model tutorial. I found that the first thing to do after importing modules is to fix random seed for reproducibility , for random numbers. That's what I don't understand 
[15:27] <5860d0cbd73408ce4f3f55a5> ``` from keras.layers import Dense import numpy # fix random seed for reproducibility numpy.random.seed(7) ```
[17:44] <5c667cfad73408ce4fb7e11a> @Devosource  So basically when you are watching a tutorial and coding along with it, you can use fix seed for the same result as in the tutorial you are watching. Just for the sake of same random number generation throughout the code whenever a random number is generated.
