<s> <user> so you want to create a set of features based on the timestamp : perhaps the hour of the timestamp only ( to determine <unka/> ), and then some duration engineered from the rest of the data . </s>
<s> <user> ok . so new features like hour and minute bin like 5 or 10 minute size will have to create . </s>
