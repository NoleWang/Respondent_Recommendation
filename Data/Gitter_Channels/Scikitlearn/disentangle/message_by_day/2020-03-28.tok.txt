<s> <user> i made some machine learning models using python <unka> library and i found some strange situation for me regarding real importance of some variables ( features ) to ml model . i found that variable which has smaller <unka> <unka> has higher importance on ml model ( when exclude variable from model using backward elimination principle ) than variables which has higher <unka> . below i send the real results of three models where first model includes all three variables and another two models excludes some variables ( - means variable is excludes ). iuse random forest method . model name mae <unk#a> <unk#.> <unk#a-> <unk#.> <unk#a-> <unk#.> <unk#a.=> , <unk#a.=> , <unk#a.=> when i exclude variables which has no importance based on <unka> ( <unk#.> ) i got model with better performance comparing to model which includes another variable ( v2 ) whic has far higher <unka> ( <unk#.> ). please , help me to explain this situation . please , answer me as soon as possible . thank you in advance . <unka> <unka> </s>
