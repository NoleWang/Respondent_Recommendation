[19:13] <5c34f182d73408ce4fb408a6> I am working on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/14131 . So, I thought that I could append a note in the docstring of `KDTree` regarding the issue. But  I looked into `sklearn/neighbors/kd_tree.pyx ` and it looks like `KDTree` is inheriting its docstring from `BinaryTree`. So can someone tell me an elegant way to append my note docstring to the inherited docstring of `KDTree` or if I could do something else to solve this issue.
