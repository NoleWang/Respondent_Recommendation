<s> <user> i am new to open source development but have worked with python for many year . i have found an issue i would like to solve . URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> i have read a fair bit on how to submit pull requests but i hesitate to do so because of my inexperience . is anybody interested in doing a review of my code before i submit so that i do not burden the community at large ? </s>
