<s> <user> hey guys , me again : regarding me previous message <unka:_> : [ october 4 , 2019 <unk#:> <unk#a(-./:=?]> ) i 've gone through some more attempts that do n't quite work . <unka@> the blog post helped a bit with my understanding of <unka-> , however i still have a few questions : can a <unka-> be initialized <unka`> <unka`> ? and no , a struct member cannot be a memory view . i tried to make my own class but then got yelled at because it 's not of type <unka`> , so that was a bust . i <unka> the <unka`> with 2 cpp vectors , but that caused things to go wonky requiring cpp in files that i 'm not willing to touch . i ended up <unka> <unka`> with 2 <unka> vectors with hard-coded length , but then ca n't seem to initialize a <unka-> into them inside of the <unka_`> . i 'm pretty much stuck ( in my current view of things ), because i 'm trying to do as little modification as possible , but it seems that in order to accomplish my task i 'll have to re-write a big chunk of <unka> methods . i'd have to add an input argument to the <unka_`> method ? that does n't sound like a good idea . any ideas ? much appreciated . </s>
