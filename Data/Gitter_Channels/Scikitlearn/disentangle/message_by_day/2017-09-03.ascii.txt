[18:50] <564789be16b6c7089cbab8b7> hi.. I want to do cross-validation but my data comes in groups. I have 10,000,000 rows in total and the sizes of the groups vary a lot. So I would really like to sample 100,000 rows first in proportion to the group sizes and then do the group cross-validation.  Is that possible?
