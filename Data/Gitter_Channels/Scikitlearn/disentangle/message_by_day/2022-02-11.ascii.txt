[18:41] <5a0d62aed73408ce4f7ed9b2> Hi, I am using TransformedTargetRegressor with KNeighborsRegressor for precomputed metric, however when I do cross validation with GridSearchCV, an error is raised saying that the dimension of the metric is not correct. The code is like this: ``` from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler target_scaler = MinMaxScaler() estimator = Pipeline([         ('scaler', MinMaxScaler()),         ('model', TransformedTargetRegressor(           KNeighborsRegressor(metric='precomputed'),           transformer=target_scaler         ))])  clf = GridSearchCV(estimator, param_grid=grid_params, 					   scoring=scoring, 					   cv=cv, return_train_score=True, refit=True, 					   error_score='raise') clf.fit(D_app, y_app) ... ``` May I ask what may be the problem? In case it is not supported, is there other ways to corrected scale targets in GridSearchCV (as well as HalvingGridSearchCV, etc.). Thank you very much!
