<s> <user> i 'm trying to understand when <unka_`> would be used in <unka()_`> in a <unka`> . <unka`> def <unka(_> , x , <unka=> , <unka*_> ): ... <unk`> are there any example pipelines that make use of this functionality ? is the point of this to allow passing additional data to a <unka`> ? if the point is to pass parameters what is the use case over adding these parameters to the <unka> init ? it seems like passing parameters would kind of go against URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> no ? </s>
<s> <user> i was also curious why <unka`> supports recursive <unka_`> ? are there times when an <unka> will have another <unka> as a parameter ? </s>
