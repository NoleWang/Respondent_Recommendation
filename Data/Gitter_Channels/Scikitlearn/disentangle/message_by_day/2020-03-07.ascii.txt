[01:39] <5e3f3d7cd73408ce4fd915a4> @vendrafilm you should actually check out that PR I just linked! It should be easy to make an MLP in Keras that supports sample_weight and then wrap it to be Scikit-Learn compatible
[06:41] <5e633ca9d73408ce4fdbe6d6> Hi, I've recently cloned the scikit-learn repository. But I'm having difficulty debugging the code in my Pycharm editor. I keep running into the infamous relative import error. Can someone pass me a reference that guides me on how to do it?  Also, please take a look at my debug configurations and let me know if something's wrong: Working directory: S:\Scikit-learn\scikit-learn\sklearn (I already marked sklearn as the source root) Python interpreter is the virtual environment I created for this. Running "pip show scikit-learn" in this env correctly shows 'Version: 0.23.dev0'. Script path: S:\Scikit-learn\scikit-learn\sklearn\ensemble\_iforest.py I even tried using Module instead of Script for debugging: "sklearn.ensemble._forest".  This just throws another runtime warning and fails. Pycharm is using "pydev debugger (build 193.6494.30)".  Am I wrong to try and debug this file? How can I debug the module as a whole? Some stack overflow discussions answer this but I couldn't figure it out for sklearn. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
[21:58] <5e614c10d73408ce4fdbbb92> @adriangb thank you, i will take a look. In fact, i need not only Adaboost to support MLP but also support different base estimators in one AdaboostClassifier.. not quite sure if it's possible
