<s> <user> <unka@> the pr regarding the <unk#a=_> in forest is ready for review </s>
<s> <user> URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> and other people there : are you ok with switching the default in <unka`> from <unka'=`> to <unka'=`> ? </s>
<s> <user> the motivation is that silently passing through uniquely identifying columns ( e.g . a user id ) will lead to catastrophic <unka> that beginner users will have a hard time to debug . </s>
<s> <user> also changing the mode of <unka-> to <unka=> in the " new mode " </s>
<s> <user> furthermore , it would also make most of our examples a bit more concise . </s>
<s> <user> <unka> is failing very quickly ( less than 1min ) for a lot of <unka> </s>
<s> <user> we have a script for fast cancelling old builds in <unka-> . here 's a [ usage <unka(]> URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a#-./_> ). this works on travis ci , <unka> , and <unka> as long as the proper environment variables are supplied ref : URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unka-./_> </s>
<s> <user> URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>

<s> <user> travis bumped our resources !! </s>
<s> <user> they rock </s>
<s> <user> we 'll need to thank them </s>
<s> <user> i 'm off until tomorrow guys . you can have a look at <unk#a#-/> and continue if you wanna merge quickly . </s>
<s> <user> hey , does anybody understand what the problem is on <unka> : URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a-./> ? </s>
<s> <user> it 's happening on several pr . i do n't love the smell of it . </s>
<s> <user> URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> is almost green on tests , ready for a second review </s>
<s> <user> looks like travis bumped up to 10 according to <unka@> </s>

<s> <user> sag test failure on python2.7 in the <unk#a=_> branch ?! </s>
<s> <user> no idea about the <unka> problem but it does seem to happen quite often . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> the <unka> issue is recent . one possibility might be that have changed something in their api and that breaks and that broke our trick to automatically cancel skip builds on <unka> that have received new push events in the mean time . </s>
<s> <user> ok , but it 's a random failure ? </s>
<s> <user> i 'll merge the <unka> despite of it . </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> you mean the <unka> , not the <unka> i mentioned , right ? </s>
<s> <user> i do n't know if it 's random with a very high likelihood or if it 's a deterministic failure . it might be a temporary outage . </s>
<s> <user> yes , i mean <unka> </s>
<s> <user> ok cool </s>
<s> <user> somebody to open the door of <unka> ;) </s>
<s> <user> i have <unka> enabled in my fork and i have some green builds recently : URL/https:/ <unka./> <unka-/> </s>
<s> <user> this could well be the http request we use which is problematic . </s>
<s> <user> i 'll look at the <unka> problem more in details . </s>
<s> <user> thanks <unka> ! </s>
<s> <user> my current reading is that we should n't have done the <unka_> <unka> in <unka_`> but in <unka> . but it depends on what we want to do in <unka_> , <unka_> and <unka_> ( and other places i have n't thought of ) </s>

<s> <user> try to fix <unka> ! </s>
<s> <user> <unka@> URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a#-/> </s>
<s> <user> so <unka@> made the good point that the <unka> warning thing should be removed in the release </s>
<s> <user> my pr is green now if someones wants to be the 2nd <unka> : URL/https:/ URL/github.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> we looked at <unka> with sik . there is a work-around in master and all the current running <unka> builds have been killed . just push a new commit in your branch if you want <unka> to run again or ask me while i have a <unka-> tab opened . </s>
<s> <user> i will also cancel all the circle ci builds as the queue is far too long . we can restart new builds on new pr ( preferably recently opened ones , or those with a recent master merge commit ). </s>
