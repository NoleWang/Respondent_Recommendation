<s> <user> i tried creating a <unk#a-> encoded csv but that would result in a <unk#a/~> file </s>
<s> <user> so what i want is saving my <unka-> values in some data format ( maybe json , which supports arrays ), and <unka-> encoding on the fly during training </s>
<s> <user> i 'm not sure where to start though , any clues ? </s>
