<s> <user> hi team , i am new to <unka> but really wants to play with the internals of <unka> . i want to test out some of the <unka> classes in the <unka> file but looks like the methods are inaccessible within python . any thought ? for example : <unka`> from <unka.> import <unka_> ph = <unk#a(._> ) <unka(> ) <unk`> and i cannot find call methods like pop , push . usually how does the workflow look like if i want to play with the internals of <unka> within jupyter notebook . </s>
