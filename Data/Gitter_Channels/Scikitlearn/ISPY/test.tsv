OQ	Hi@AlexDBlack, one question regarding  the MNISTAnomalyExample: when outputting the Worst(High Rec. Err) digits (or called outliers), are they correctly recognized ? In other words, they are recognized as ground-truth digits, but have large reconstruction error.  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	anomaly detection and classification are different tasksthere is no "correctly recognized" in anomaly detection __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	the output Worst(High Rec. Err) digits are considered as anomalies/outliers? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	yes __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	if this is to demo a simple autocoder, it is fine. But if it is to demo the accuracy of the model, it is inadequate -- many outliers do not look like outliers. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	thewzhang: the autocoder doesn\'t know what "outlier" means __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	Thanks Alex. Actually my data are stored in a database , and I planed to  load and convert them to CSV files so that I could use D4J built-in DataIterator, but it is not feasible to create a million files , so I am wondering there are other built-in methods for this  :)  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	the autoencoder example is quite simple... so I have still plenty of questions. first of all, there are many types of autoencoders such as Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder, Contractive autoencoder... which does DL4J support?do I need to do something special to make an autoencoder that is  Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder or Contractive autoencoder?  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

FD	alex merged it few days ago __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	nice! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	daredemo: There are small special things for each of the subtypes of autoencoders.  Sparse has a penalty (usually L1) which encourages sparse activation in the inner-most hidden layer.  Denoising adds noise on the input and attempts to reconstruct a noise free output.  Variational autoencoders instead learn a mean and standard deviation instead of an explicit internal state, then randomly generate a hidden state from those values and reconstruct. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

CQ	FlyingPiggyKing: wait what? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CQ	Are you trying to build from source? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
JK	No where in our docs do we tell you to do that :D __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
IG	Use maven central please __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	dl4j has 4 projects including c code you need to build from source __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	I wouldn't suggest trying that __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Especially if you're new __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
NF	I just want to dig into the code, see how it works, but I see many code error, like some function is missing... __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	FlyingPiggyKing: yeah don't do that __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
JK	like at all __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
IG	use intellij to download the source __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	and run it in the debugger if you want to do that __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	otherwise you have to build from source __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Like I said you have to build 4 projects to even get to dl4j __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	You sound completely new to a lot of this __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	I wouldn't suggest digging in unless you have to __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Of course you'r going to have errors __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	You need to build the other libraries first __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Don't do it unless you have a compelling reason to __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	if you want to just explore don't clone dl4j __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	FlyingPiggyKing: you can view the source from intellij using the maven release, just ctrl+b on the various classes, and you can read through them therewithout the headaches associated with  building from source :) __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	AlexDBlack: so you mean let idea to decompile the code from the jar? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	no, not decompile. download sources __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	FlyingPiggyKing: I already said the source is in maven central __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	those are on maven central too __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
PF	AlexDBlack: ok, got __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AC	let me try __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
PF	yes, it work for some of the class, like MultiLayerNetwork.java, I can click on the link on the top bar of IDEA, it can download it, while for some class like MultiLayerConfiguration.class, seems like the class is inconsistent with the downloaded source code. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	FlyingPiggyKing: intellij is usually weird about that I wouldn't pay too much attention to it __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	That's usually because of source code comments and the like __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CQ	it might also be lombok annotation maybe, expanded in binaries but not source? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	anyway, not a concern really __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	there some minor error in the source code, like the logger declaration is missing, I see@Slf4j, this maybe the reason __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IR	FlyingPiggyKing: that's lombok like alex mentioned __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
PF	got it, very thanks! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	have you got a code example which simply has working code for tsne plot on word2vec output?  the document only has snippet  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	code for? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	for single method call? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
OP	and the TSNEStandardExample.java does not plot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
JK	i’ve already pointed you to method you need __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	like TSNEStandardExample.java, except one that actually put up a plot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
JK	there’s nothing more needed from you __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
NF	so you don't have such an example code __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
