OQ	hey.. i got my caddyserver working.. i get a database error now from wordpress container  this is the link [<-LINK->]   Error establishing a database connection  Hello,I got Caddyserver running. The Database is working correctly now and moved the domain to point to my new server. Somehow I get just a clear Website, even when I curl the webseite I get zero response.I have made a look into the Caddyserver logs and WordPress logs and I get the request, but no response. I also installed nginx as a container and served the nginx to Caddy to see if Caddy is proxying correctly. I get the welcome screen from nginx. So this is working fine, but when I again bind the WordPress container to Caddy its just nothing.Do you have a clue what can be the reason to get no response on the client but requests on the server?Thank you!  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	I've got an array of objects, and I've got an issue where something works if I unshift a new object into the array, but if I push an object then it doesn't work. Because I'm guessing that the array isn't being redrawn in the same way when I push. Is there any way to force a redraw so it behaves the same for unshift and push?@DzmitryShylovich Any idea?  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
