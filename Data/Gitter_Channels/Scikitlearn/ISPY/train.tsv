OQ	I think, I have something important to say.It's the second time that this happens with me. I install docker on Linux Mint and after some hours the disk is full. Dont know why this happens, but I found out one thing, that also happens these two times. I lost all my system backups (I use timeshift). I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that. Until there, I will be using docker on a virtual machine, because I cant trust this software anymore.  "Fix that."  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

CC	Z3roCoder: you should wrap your code in ``` __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

UF	There we go :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	interfaces aren't exclusive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	they only require properties be there __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it doesn't care about extra properties __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	But in case 2 and 3, it requires exactly the properties in the interface __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	b is not in the interface, and this it complains that b shouldnt be there __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	return{a : 3 b:3}satisfies the interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	Look at my screenshot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	oh ... on object literals yeah __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	you need to do any on object literals if you want it to work __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So this is expected behaviour? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	yes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's mostly designed for when you are passing object literals to function __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	When is, and when isn't, something a object literal in my example? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Isn't <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; also a object literal? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	yeah but then you are casting it specifically to an ITest __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So what's the difference then betweenreturn <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; andconst c: ITest = { a: 3, b: 3 } (This complains) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	what version are you using? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	2.1.4 __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	So the thinking is if you are setting extra properties you'll never be able to safely access them from the interface that you are assigning __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so the compiler assumes this is likely an error on your part __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	and you have to use type assertion to get around it __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	Why would this not apply to test4 then? This is basically the same example as test3, only that in this case, a Promise of the type ITest is returned __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	probably an edge case the compiler does not consider __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	Alright, i will write a issue about this then __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Maybe then it will become clearer __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	If I've got a docker container running docker (teamcity agent running builds) what is the best way to mount a volume in the 'parent' container into the 'child' container?  The 'parent' container has the host docker socket bound (-v /var/run/docker.sock:) so when the agent (parent container) tries to run a new container and pass some -v flags; the -v flags don't get mounted correctly as far as I can tell  presumably because it's not actually a child; but a sibling; and the directory trying to be mounted doesn't actually exist outside the 'parent'  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	I'm new to docker and have been working at getting react-starter-kit up and running for dev and prod using docker-compose. I keep running into issues no matter how I seem to go about it.  Using straight docker I get it running but I can't seem to browse to the server thats running in the container.  When I use docker-compose I get an error likesh: babel-node: not found which I think might be happening because for some reason the container is not in the right directory  Anyone that might be able to lend a hand would be very appreciated  Easier question.... for those looking to use docker for dev workflows that use hot reloading/auto reloading.... is there a best practise for node_modules folder? I mean the node_modules folder needs to be compiled on the container but conversely I need to setup a volume for the src so hot reloading works. Seems odd tonpm iinto a tmp folder in the dockerfile and then get docker-compose to copy that over into the host machine volume. Not to mention that folder being leftover after compose is shut down.  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	Is there any way to change the default data directory in Windows 10? I'd like to put it on a volume other than my "C:" drive. Space is limited on "C:" for me as I have a non-standard partition set up, and I believe it would perform better (as well as have some more data robustness) on a RAID5 volume I have available.  Also, the "Start Mining" option which is only available on the testnet, is there any schedule for when that option will be fully functional. Currently I use genoil's ethminer, but it would be interesting to have this fully integrated with the main core app.  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hello everyone. If someone can please explain to me what's the difference between comment._id, comment.id and comment_id? I saw colt have used all three kinds so far and it has left people completely lost now on which convention to use in the future.

Thank you in advance.  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Does anyone know how to fix VS from showing zillions of typescript errors from my d.ts files? I have a build working perfectly using webpack but it shows  all kinds of TS2307 errors and such that are taken care of via webpackexternalsand other packages. (I am invoking webpack via a build target and also <TypescriptCompileBlocked /> in the csproj)  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PG	For TS2307 you need to either use the path mapping facilities in tsconfig or generate dummy module definitions usingdeclare module 'whatever' __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	visual studio can be weird sometimes though, do you see the same errors when compiling  from commandline using plain tsc? (no webpack) __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	It's strange though that you would need externals and packages for code in your declaration files __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so i'd be interested to know the specifics of one or two pacakges that you are seeing that error for __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	another strategy is to use wildcard declarations __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	hmm I am a bit of a noobie at setting up the thing, I guess. I am using ts-loader and have never tried to get it to compile with just tsc __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	I use tsloader, but it still compiles fine with tsc for me __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	declare module 'xxx';did not work, it says "Invalid module name in augmentation" __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	let me see if I can add the paths to tsconfig.json __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	can I just add it to rootDirs? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	Well I'm trying to understand what modules you are actually mapping to somewhere else __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	to see if you are doing it correctly or not __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	declare module 'xxx'needs to be in  ad.tsfile __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	It's actually just not finding the modules from the same folder. I have a fileaddress.tsxinside a folder calledsrcwhich also has a file calledclientdata.ts; in address.tsx I haveimport {states} from "clientdata";and it isn't finding clientdata. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	oh  ok.. so it' snot from yourd.tsfiles that's the problem __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	Actually I changed it to "./clientdata" and that seemed to work __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	yeah so when you don't do relative paths.. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it will try to resolve modules fromnode_modules __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
JK	ohh __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	even though I added my src folder to rootDirs? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	it will walk up your folders __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so first don't add your src folder torootDirs __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	you want to set it forrootDir __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	now... if youw ant it to work like you had __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	you need to add some path mappings __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	I see... I am ok with using './' I think it is probably a better practice __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FQ	I do have one more question, it is not happening on my computer but it is happening on my friend's. He tried to open it up and has 1000s of "duplicate identifier" errors from d.ts files. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	webpack build also does work on his machine __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	you can use baseUrl too for it to work without relative paths __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	for best intellisense and IDE support it's always good to make sure your project compiles fine through planetsc __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	just make sure you do --noEmit or something __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	unless you want a gazillion .js files generated throughout your codebase __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	or use outDir __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	I would have to know the duplicate identifiers __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's likely stuff in hisnode_module/@types/*folder conflicting with maybe old-school typings files from typings or tsd __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FQ	Also, should the d.ts files be included in the project? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	you should get rid of the typings/tsd installed ones if they have that __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	you should include d.ts  files in the project yes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	you don't need to include any that are installed with npm in@typesthough __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	Got it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	ususally people will have 1 or 2 custom ones __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	that are included globally __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	or if a particular project has a stand-alone typings file they publish outside of  definitely typed (more rare) __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	most projects will either include d.ts file in the standard npm package (e.g. like angular2 for example) or they will have third-party typings you can install using@types/package-name __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's rare to have a project just have their own random d.ts file you donwload and install,  although there are a few cases out there __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

I do not expect any errors based on the change I made. Travis is failing on the PR and it seems like it has something to do with TypeScript versions — I doubt it was my change. Is this normal?  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	howdy... just joined gitter today in order to work with the Plone community.  i got connected to the IRC bridge, and it works okay... however, my client is being queried (/who) once per minute, littering my logs with useless messages.

Also, it would super nifty if that bridge could (optionally? bi-directionally?) convert '<nick>:' at the start of a line to '@<nick>', so as  to improve interoperability between the two conventions of addressing individuals in a room.  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	I\'m developing an angular 2 app. So essentialy, if I run the app with "ng serve" all works fine, if I refresh the page (for example [<-LINK->] ) it works fine and angular recognizes the right route.

At this point the routing navigation works fine but if I refresh the page I receive a "Not found error".

OQ	hey guys  quick question...  is there a way to docker monitor if a service inside the container is alive or not?  I mean, the main ENTRYPOINT is alive, so from docker perspective, the container is running however, some internal crap happen on the app and I need docker to check with some sort of heartbeat the application (idk, a ping on a specific port or whatever) and if it does'nt reply, just kill the container... is it possible?  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	need some health monitoring internal and external to the container; something internal to keep checking the status of what you need running/accessible, and something external to poll it once in a while to know to kill/restart it.... there's unfortunately so many ways to accomplish this, it just depends on what level of effort you want to put into it. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	I had trouble with the new version 0.8.7  it would not sync properly , it was syncing but was so slow it would never have cought up with it's self . I have now gone back to 0.8.6 .Could my problems have been due to the hard fork as that was the reason i updated to 0.8.7 ? Seeing as the Gethub site said the update was for those that use Mist and did not effect those that are just using the wallet as it does not access the internet.  I have read that others also had trouble syncing the new version 0.8.7 and that is the reason i stop trying with 0.8.7 and went back to 0.8.6 . I think it may follow the wrong Chain at block 1,346,??? not shore about that but the chain data started to bloat and get very big conpared to the size of the chain data that i currently have with 0.8.6 that was up to date as of about 36 hrs ago  I also had trouble with 0.8.6 the first time . It would not sync . I then use Gerth and reved DB and then reloaded it the chain data with this command geth --fast --support-dao-fork --cache=512 --maxpeers 99 --jitvm and this worked  Don't know what you have done but i am getting F-ing pissed off with the wallet not syncing and what the hell has the wallet downloaded new binary's ??????  Geth folder now has to folders with binary's what the hell is the new binay for , i now have 3 versions of geth 2 in the folder Geth in there own folders and 1 version in the geth folder.

OQ	I also have 2 instructions, one updates my ruby gems, and one updates my node packages. No matter how i go about this, at some point one of those cache layers will be invalidated for no reason because the other changes  the Dockerfile is a naively simple tool  would have been much more powerful if they had given us a ruby DSL to build out dockerfile descriptions, that way we could have implemented caching as we pleased  bbl  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
AE	hmm, wish I could help, but I'm equally as stuck __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
IG	siassaj: you simply combine your two commands into one "call" and this would create a single layer with all the changes from both, IIRC you can also while building a container run a couple commands from the command line and then "commit" afterwards in order to control when the layer actually gets saved __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Hi !  (sorry for the pic, that wasn't meant to go here)  I really like gitter, and was thinking "what about a more compact theme ?"  the "chat" zone is ok, but a more compact "left" zone may be a good option  for touch device, the tall "contact" items in lists is great but on a computer, the more I have on screen, the better it is  What do you think about it ?   [<-LINK->]  that was a quick "console hack" but I think space is important. Scrolling to find a room/person is really boring now :)  And with all this space, adding separators or categories may be interesting  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
UF	mtancoigne: thanks …  __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
NF	maybe boring, but if scrolling will be desirable or required then a scroll bar and scroller should be visible. (If there's a bar in your shot, I can't see it.) __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hello everyone. Why does Gitter client have such a high energy impact on mac OS? It constantly reports as high energy impact and that it requires the discrete graphics chip on macbook pro  This is while running in the gitter client and while running in safari.  running in Chrome does not appear to have that issue  I've also noticed a lot of spinning when posting messages with markdown on a very slow or flaky network/internet connection  is this some issue with gitter client itself or more likely a safari/webkit issue?   [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	I’m not educated on this topic, but could it be that the Gitter client is just an Electron wrapper? __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Because, if that’s the case, you’re running another instance of Chrome. But again, this is just speculation. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
