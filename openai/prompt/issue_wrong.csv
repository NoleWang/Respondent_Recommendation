"Hi! I have just noticed, that `[ngSwitch]=""condition""` starts displaying the new matching element before removing the old one when `condition` changes, meaning that elements for both the previous and the current switch cases are visible for a moment (a change detection cycle most likely). Is it intended behavior? Is there a workaround?"

how can I know if an update comes with schematics/upgrades/migrations? I don't see anything happening for core/cli/material when updating and I don't see any information anywhere about if they're provided or not.

"Can I ask you a question? I strongly believe that the front end should get the right data without the least manipulation. But the one guy is doing like 4 for loops to get the right data from the frontend. For example, parent order - order - products are the hierarchical level of the raw data. I want to get products level of data as we are showing products on the view. But what a guy is doing is for loop in the frontend doing a lot of manipulation. I want to explain him why this is a bad idea.. but I can't find any resources reliable why this is bad in terms of security, reliability of the data."

The data downloads quickly, the problem comes after [I set a property] (which, to be fair, *contains* all the data) on a component.

"Hi all, I'm currently in the process of upgrading my project from version 6 to 12. My current setup is two repos: one with library projects and one with an app that consumes the libraries. The usual workflow is to watch for library code changes (e.g. `ng build @myLibs/foo --watch`) and make sure that the consumer app picks up the changes by running `ng build myApp --watch`. The link between them is made by running `npm link` in the libs dist folder and then `npm link @mylibs/foo` in the consumer app workspace. So far it worked perfectly in Angular 6 - the watcher on the consumer app picked up any changes to the linked library and recompiled a new bundle that reflected them. After upgrading to Angular 12, I can see that the watcher for the consumer app detects some changes as soon as the lib watcher finishes recompiling, but the changes are not reflected in the output bundle anymore. Can someone please help me with this? I've tried everything I could think of."
