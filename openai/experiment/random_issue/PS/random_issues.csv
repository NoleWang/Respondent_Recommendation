"Hi there, implementing my thesis in java, quite advanced reinforcement learning technique. I would love to use dl4j. What am I struggling is to find some good example of RL with data handling and training (dense network is fine for now, what I need is to understand how data iterators and fetchers work).

I was checking some of your examples, but they are very deeply encapsulated that I can't see the whole picture.
