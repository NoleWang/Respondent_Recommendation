I'm still struggling with making a custom form input.   @mlc-mlapis was kind enough to help me a few days ago and answered just the question I asked, as well as gave me a great tip that I should be reading about Control Value Accessor. So, I did that, and I'm now trying to implement my custom form control as using CVA. I  Sadly, it's still not working 100%. The issue comes up when trying to perform validation on the custom control. I have a full [example over on stackblitz], with instructions for how to reproduce the issue I'm having.   One more piece of advice I got from @mlc-mlapis  was to implement getters/setters on my `@Input` directives. I have not implemented that as of yet, and maybe that's the problem? I don't know how it would be, but what do I know?  Probably the most helpful article I've found so far on implementing Control Value Accessor is [this one] from Max Koretskyi over on indepth.dev. I'd welcome any other input on how to make this work.   I guess the good thing is that I'm learning a bunch along the way in trying to write this dumb little custom form control.
