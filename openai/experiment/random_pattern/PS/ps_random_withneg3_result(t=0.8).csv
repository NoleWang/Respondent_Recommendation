angular,"hey guys, got a weird one here. I'm using ng-select in my app, but it's used hundreds of times all over the place, so to make usage consistent and to make updating all of them easier, we made a wrapper component which has the ng-select inside it. It's mostly working very well, the only problem is with projected content. So ng-select supports projected content with `ng-option` elements, so you can do, e.g. this: [code]. This would allow options in the select list to have custom span inside them. But I cannot get this working in my wrapper. The template for the wrapper looks like: [code]. And from other templates I would use it like: [code]. I would expect projected content to be passed straight through to inner `ng-select`, but it's not working at all.
