angular,"hey guys, got a weird one here. I'm using ng-select in my app, but it's used hundreds of times all over the place, so to make usage consistent and to make updating all of them easier, we made a wrapper component which has the ng-select inside it. It's mostly working very well, the only problem is with projected content. So ng-select supports projected content with `ng-option` elements, so you can do, e.g. this: [code]. This would allow options in the select list to have custom span inside them. But I cannot get this working in my wrapper. The template for the wrapper looks like: [code]. And from other templates I would use it like: [code]. I would expect projected content to be passed straight through to inner `ng-select`, but it's not working at all. If I move the `ng-content` tags out of between `ng-select` then the mark-up is rendered, but ng-select cannot use it. What am I missing?

,"Hi all, I'm currently in the process of upgrading my project from version 6 to 12. My current setup is two repos: one with library projects and one with an app that consumes the libraries. The usual workflow is to watch for library code changes (e.g. `ng build @myLibs/foo --watch`) and make sure that the consumer app picks up the changes by running `ng build myApp --watch`. The link between them is made by running `npm link` in the libs dist folder and then `npm link @mylibs/foo` in the consumer app workspace. So far it worked perfectly in Angular 6 - the watcher on the consumer app picked up any changes to the linked library and recompiled a new bundle that reflected them.
