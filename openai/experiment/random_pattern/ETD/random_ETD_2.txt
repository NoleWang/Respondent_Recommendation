ETD_TRYING_TO :  I'm trying to implement this function interface like: [<-CODE->] It's working for the no-arg version, but even if I call with an arg it still calls the no-arg version... is there an easy way to implement that interface correctly?

ETD_GOING_TO :  I'm creating a new platform on Ethereum. The issue I see arising is funding so I'm going to do an ICO. Since I am not reputable in the community, I would like to have a reputable developer advise for my project or perhaps work with me.  Any ideas of where to start or ask around?

ETD_CONSIDER_ACTION :  Seeking help using aws-sdk with typescript. Followed directions at [<-LINK->] to add <reference types="aws-sdk" />, but still geterror TS2686: 'AWS' refers to a UMD global, but the current file is a module. Consider adding an import instead. That causes bundling issues: rollup complains thatS3 is not exported by node_modules/aws-sdk/lib/aws.js

ETD_CAN_QUESTION :  Hey Guys, how can I rotate the log files of my containers. I tried 2 different approaches: 1) add this lines to my docker compose file [<-CODE->] 2) use logrotate to rotate files, which leads to the problem, that even when the file is renamed like node.log.1 the container is still logging into this file until the container is restared are newly generated. what is best practice in terms of log rotation?

ETD_SUPPOSED_TO :  What's the official way of getting a word from a matrix index in the ParagraphVectors model? I'm getting IDs back in the form of "null123456789" from method. The documentation says it's supposed to return null if the thing can't be found or it should return a word from the vocab. This is neither, and I got what I'm doing from example code. The only difference is that I saved and then loaded this model before trying to run this. In the example code, they do not save or load the model. I'm asking if it's an issue Or expected behavior And, more importantly, about any mitigation / workaround steps

ETD_IMPLEMENT :  Hi, I am aware that DL4J is recommended to be used with Java 8 but is there any way I can use DL4J with Java 10 and IntelliJ (with or w/out Maven is fine, knowing that Maven have some quirks with Java 10 as well). I was thinking of building with Maven with java SDK 8 and then running the project with java sdk 10 with imported jars from java 8 sdk that the project requires. I have success so far by getting rid of all the exceptions through from the dl4j-examples but I still have this exception.

ETD_THINK_ABOUT :  Does anyone have an example how to load an ssl cert off a volume? johannwagner: well, for a new production setup with commercial wildcard I would like the nginx container to load the cert off the host when possible. So I am looking for the best way to do this is the nginx Docker file. Thought of connecting host to container and store cert on the host, but not sure if that is the best way and how I would do this Aha.

ETD_EXPECTED :  Anyone good with git? I'm getting some weird behavior and I can't quite make sense of it when I do git rebase -i HEAD~3 it shows the commits in this order:  ``` commit 1 commit 2 commit 3 ```. I would expect it to be: ``` commit 3 commit 2 commit 1 ```
