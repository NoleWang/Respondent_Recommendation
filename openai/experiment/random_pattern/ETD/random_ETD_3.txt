ETD_GOING_TO :  Architecting an in-house solution for DL4J training. I'm getting ready to acquire some servers that I'm going to use to train via Apache Spark. My question is... If I scale horizontally (the more servers added), is the efficiency of training going to be linear or logarithmic? Or in other words, is network chatter across nodes going to hamper the effectiveness of training as I add more nodes? Are there other problems in the mix?

ETD_CONSIDER_ACTION :  Hi Everyone,  I'm considering configuring a multi-project repo.  I realise that the nx tools exist but wandered how far I can get with the standard angular-cli setup.  Indeed I would rather not have to really on a further tool beyond angular cli.  I've read that Angular CLI supports multi project repos :https://angular.io/guide/file-structure#multiple-projects. However I'm after information of how to configure build and test of these atomically (along with how to transition from a traditional angular CLI repo).  I was wandering whether any of you friendly folk may have written an article on this (accessible if not registered on medium) or indeed have any tips?

ETD_CAN_QUESTION :  Hi guys. How can I use Docker with Angular CLI? I want to be able to build my app and push it to a production docker container that is serving nginx as well. So the problem is, I want to build a dist folder in the docker container, and during development I would be able to watch the folder and serve the webapp Anyone could provide some guidance on how I could do this?

ETD_SUPPOSED_TO :  Hey guys, I have a problem mounting my local folder with docker-compose. Anybody having the same problem on OSX? When i try to set the folder in which my docker-composer.yml and my Dockerfile are as a volume which is supposed to be stored in /var/www/html for instance, It wont work. Even if I check manually via shell while the container is up and running. marcelmfs: I dont want to use an ADD from wihtin the dockerfile because I need to be able to change the files live, while the container is running, since its going to be a dev environment. marcelmfs: I think I have figured it out :)

ETD_IMPLEMENT :  Hi everyone, I just wanted to seek for some advice regarding Folder structure/ architecture when building a PWA app with Angular. I've been trying to find some tutorials or articles online but couldn't find any (I did find something last week but wasn't able to save the url of that article, although that link didn't also include any sample code just more on thoery)

ETD_THINK_ABOUT :  Hello everyone, does anyone know if there is an 'Angular way' of solving the font flickering (so called FOUT) problem? I have been thinking about using spinners, loaders or some sort of a css trick prior to the Angular bootstrapping or an HTTP request or the component loading, but this doesn't appear to me to be a problem-solver. The shortest way would probably be rel="preload" alongside the link of my google font, but I am worried about performance. And this approach also comes with a handy of other problems.

ETD_EXPECTED :  I am using angularfire library to delete a record in the realtime DB and nebular dialog box. now this funtion has deleted all records one by one which was not expected as I expect it to delete only one record. what is wrong in this function ? seems like some infinite loop is running?
