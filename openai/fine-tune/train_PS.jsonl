{"prompt":"Hi all, I'm currently in the process of upgrading my project from version 6 to 12. My current setup is two repos: one with library projects and one with an app that consumes the libraries. The usual workflow is to watch for library code changes (e.g. `ng build @myLibs\/foo --watch`) and make sure that the consumer app picks up the changes by running `ng build myApp --watch`. The link between them is made by running `npm link` in the libs dist folder and then `npm link @mylibs\/foo` in the consumer app workspace. So far it worked perfectly in Angular 6 - the watcher on the consumer app picked up any changes to the linked library and recompiled a new bundle that reflected them. After upgrading to Angular 12, I can see that the watcher for the consumer app detects some changes as soon as the lib watcher finishes recompiling, but the changes are not reflected in the output bundle anymore.

This would allow options in the select list to have custom span inside them. But I cannot get this working in my wrapper. The template for the wrapper looks like: [code].

{"prompt":"I am talking about data manipulation. What I am expecting is getting the correct data from the backend. You can do that by assigning properties right. THen we do not need to use for loop 4 times to assign the data to new array or models. This is a partial code of data manipulation on the client side after the async is finished [code]. this this a lot.. and do the calculation of total by using += \/\/ -=.. Single reponsibility, single unit of work. Calculation is done by in the class properties but on the client side, it's doing the same thing. it's against a lot of existing principles such as single reponsibility. If you change the backend you must come to the front end to add the data. that's the flow of how the store works to have a nice effect on the UI. We have an interface or typed model to define which model to show on the UI. But that ugly code has no model at all. dynamically assign it, then you should go to another place to add the field again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":"0"}
